<h2>Chapter I</h2>

<p>“Lucky again, partner,” commented Westenhanger,
breaking into Eileen Cressage’s thoughts as he took
up the scoring-block. “That’s game and rubber,
Douglas. Your mind must be wandering.”</p>

<p>Douglas Fairmile had glanced down the room to
where a fair-haired girl was sitting with a rather
red-faced man. Douglas’s brows contracted slightly.
That fellow Morchard had attempted to monopolise
Cynthia this evening; but surely anyone could see
that the girl was bored. A persistent creature,
Morchard—rather too persistent at times, Douglas felt.
Then at the sound of Westenhanger’s voice, his
attention came back to the bridge-table.</p>

<p>“Game and rubber?” he repeated. “Sorry,
partner. My fault entirely. You see, I’m getting rusty
in auction nowadays. It’s nearly gone out at my
club; nobody plays it any more. We’re all on to this
new game that’s just come in.”</p>

<p>“New game? What new game?” demanded
Westenhanger, arranging the cards for his shuffle. “Have
the Cardsharpers rediscovered Old Maid or the
simple joys of Happy Families? Out with it,
Douglas.”</p>

<p>Douglas Fairmile made a gesture as though
apologising for Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“Tut! Tut! He’s jealous, poor fellow. My
fault for mentioning the Romarin Club. A sore
subject with Conway, and no wonder. You know, we
have an entrance examination for candidates: test
’em in following suit and remembering what’s trump.
And somehow Conway didn’t get in. Or else he was
afraid to enter. A sad business, anyhow; don’t let’s
dwell on it. So he calls us the Cardsharpers out of
spite.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton began to deal. Douglas
passed the box of cigarettes to Eileen; and, when
she refused, took one himself. Westenhanger looked
at him with feigned anxiety.</p>

<p>“I notice a certain tendency to wander in your
talk, of late. This inconsecutiveness of mind is
growing on you, Douglas. Do you ever find
yourself, in the morning, putting on your jacket first and
your waistcoat afterwards? Pull yourself together.
Squails Up-to-Date, or something like that, was what
you were trying to tell us about before you began to
ramble.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Suspension Bridge, that’s it. Suspension
Bridge. Never heard of it? Well, well. These
soulless mechanics! You take the two of spades
out of the pack, put in a joker instead; and then
play according to auction rules. You’ve no notion
of the superior feeling it gives you when you go No
Trump with five aces in your hand. Confidence,
that’s the word! A splendid game.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” Westenhanger conceded,
sarcastically. “Invite me to take a hand in the inaugural
game, will you? It’ll be an historic occasion, no
doubt; and I might get my name into the
newspapers.”</p>

<p>Douglas looked hurt.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t believe me, Eileen; he thinks I’m . . .
Oh, sorry!”</p>

<p>He picked up his cards, and the game continued.
For the third time in succession, Eileen Cressage
laid down her hand with an inaudible sigh of relief.
Being dummy, she could think about other things
than the table before her. She had never been a
keen bridge-player; her card-memory was too weak
for anything beyond the most obvious tactics. And
on this evening especially, her interest in the game
was of the slightest. She played mechanically; and
she had quite failed to note how, time and again, a
skilful intervention by her partner had extricated her
from a risky declaration.</p>

<p>As Westenhanger gathered up their first trick, her
mind went back to her ever-present money
difficulties. Some bills had reached her by the last post.
Somehow, bills always dropped in at that time; and
she had begun to dread the very sight of an unsealed
envelope among her correspondence. If these
wretched things had come in the morning, the affairs
of the day might have helped to put them out of her
mind; but when they arrived after dinner, they
seemed to rivet her attention through the whole night.</p>

<p>The problems of a girl trying to keep up a decent
appearance on a tiny income seemed to be
approaching an insoluble state. Her quarter’s income was
nearly exhausted; and yet something would have to
be done. It was no use approaching her trustees in
the hope of anticipating her income for the next
three months. She had tried that before; and all
she had got was a lecture on the folly of
over-spending. It appeared that the thing was impossible
under the will. Besides, the trustees were simply
lawyers, without a spark of personal interest in her
affairs or herself. So far as they were concerned,
Eileen Cressage was a name on a deed-box or a
docket. No help there, obviously.</p>

<p>And yet something would have to be done. She
could pay some of her creditors and leave the rest
of the affairs standing; but which people ought she
to attend to first? Her mind was busy with a sort
of jig-saw puzzle with the bills as a picture and the
available money as the pieces; but with half the
fragments missing, it was a hopeless business. One
fact was evident: some of these bills would have to
be settled, and settled soon.</p>

<p>With an effort she put the whole affair at the back
of her mind and tried to divert her attention. But
her first glance across the room brought the thing
back to her from a different angle. There was her
host, old Rollo Dangerfield, sitting in a despondent
attitude beside the window. What had he to be
low-spirited about? If she herself owned the
Dangerfield Talisman, her troubles would be conjured away.
The thing was worth £50,000 on the last occasion
when it had been valued; and the price of diamonds
had gone up a good deal since then.</p>

<p>Her eyes passed to where Mrs. Brent and the
American collector sat. Neither of them had money
worries. At sixty, Mrs. Brent seemed to get a good
deal out of life; and the steam yacht in the bay at
the foot of the garden was a fair proof that a few
hundred pounds one way or the other was not likely
to trouble her.</p>

<p>A rustle of the cards brought Eileen’s attention
to the bridge table. She leaned back a little in her
chair and glanced, with an envy which was quite
devoid of malice, at the three players intent on their
game.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s husband had been one of
those hard-faced men who had made fortunes in the
War. When he died she had got the money; and
her enemies said that the hard face had been
bequeathed also, in a codicil to his will. She certainly
had a very keen appreciation of the value of a
Treasury note.</p>

<p>Then there was Douglas Fairmile, with a big
private income. His only worry at present was
whether Cynthia Pennard would marry him or not.
No great need for anxiety there, Eileen reflected.
Cynthia wasn’t throwing herself at his head,
certainly; but it was one of those affairs which are
bound to come right in the end. If only her own
affairs would look as bright!</p>

<p>Finally, her partner, Conway Westenhanger, very
obviously hadn’t a care in the world. Those
mechanical inventions of his were known to be small
gold mines; he wasn’t in love with anyone; and he
got on well with people. What more could a man
want?</p>

<p>Half unconsciously she compared the two men.
Douglas was once described to her as “one of those
delightful people who can always be cheery without
getting on your nerves with it.” He had the gift
of playing the fool in season without looking like a
fool while he was doing it. One laughed with him,
always, and never at him. Conway Westenhanger
was a more complex person, but just as attractive in
his own way. She liked his mouth; its clean-cut
lines seemed to have something sympathetic in their
curves; and the thinker’s sharply-marked vertical
lines between the eyebrows rather added to the
attractiveness of his face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent broke the silence, addressing her host.
“Rollo! would you mind if we have that window
opened further? The heat’s almost unbearable
to-night.”</p>

<p>Old Dangerfield came out of his brown study with
a start, made a gesture of acquiescence, and threw
open the window to its full extent. Through the
embrasure a faint breath of air wandered in from
the outer twilight, laden with the smell of parched
soil and the heavy perfume of flowers; but it brought
no coolness with it.</p>

<p>“I suppose this doesn’t affect you, Mr. Wraxall?”
Mrs. Brent turned to the American beside her.
“You’re a New Yorker, aren’t you? Heat waves
won’t trouble you as much as they do me. You’re
acclimatised, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“It’s warm to-night. It’s certainly not what one
calls cool. But I’ll admit that I’ve known it hotter
over there. And this air of yours hasn’t got that
used-up feeling about it that city air has. It’s
fresh, even if it’s hot. You’d know it was garden air
and not street air, even if the flowers weren’t there.
But you’re wrong about my being acclimatised. I
don’t use New York much in the summer.”</p>

<p>“Of course, you’ve got a country big enough to
let you choose your climate for almost any day in the
year, haven’t you? Well, there’s something to be
said for an island. If this heat gets worse I shall
simply take the <i>Kestrel</i> away for a night or two
until the hot spell is over. Another couple of days
of this would be unbearable. Luckily the
Dangerfields understand me; they won’t be offended if I
disappear without warning. One would think twice
about doing that with most people, but Friocksheim
is a real Liberty Hall.”</p>

<p>“They’ve been very kind in asking me down,” the
American explained. “I didn’t know them; but I
got an introduction; and when I explained I was
interested in some of their things, they invited me
to stay for a few days.”</p>

<p>He glanced through the window and across the
moonlit bay which stretched beyond the lawns.</p>

<p>“The <i>Kestrel</i>? Little white yacht with copper
funnels, lying in the bay? Is that the one? I saw
her as I drove up here this evening.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the <i>Kestrel</i>. You liked her looks?”</p>

<p>“Very pretty. Graceful lines, she has. My own
yacht’s rather larger; but she’s not so neat, not so
neat. I wanted lots of room on board.”</p>

<p>“The very thing I didn’t want on the <i>Kestrel</i>.
I use her as a kind of retreat, Mr. Wraxall, the place
for a rest-cure. I’ve never had a guest on board;
there isn’t even a spare cabin. Sometimes I want to
get clean away from everybody; and that was the
best way I could think of for managing it. Callers
don’t drop in when one’s fifty miles from port.”</p>

<p>The American looked at her with interest kindling
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You feel that way, too? That’s interesting.
That’s very interesting. I take it you’re not a
philanthropist, then?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent shifted her position slightly and looked
up at her neighbour’s clean-shaven face. It was of
the long rather than the square American type, the
face of a man with a certain imagination.</p>

<p>“If you mean contributing to charitable funds
and that sort of thing, I’m certainly not
philanthropic,” she answered. “I don’t think I’ve spent a
penny in that way during the last ten years. People
come bothering me with tales of sad cases; at least
they used to do that. But once you get the name of
being kind-hearted, you’re simply pestered to death
by demands, mostly from frauds. I’ve shed that
reputation long ago. I don’t say I don’t give
something here and there. Everybody does. But
unless I see a thing with my own eyes I refuse to part
with a farthing. My eyesight is still fairly good for
my age; and I’m quite able to see a thing for myself
without needing some fussy creature to point it out
to me.”</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly and showed her fine teeth
in a faint smile.</p>

<p>“You’ve touched there on a thing that always
irritates me. I’ve got rather a bad reputation over it.
They call me a skinflint. There’s an American
phrase for that, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“You mean a tight-wad, perhaps. Yes, that
would be it, a tight-wad.”</p>

<p>He dismissed the subject, seeming to think of
something else.</p>

<p>“A minute or two back you were saying you
wanted to get away from humanity now and again.
I sympathise with you there. I can understand the
feeling. I open the newspaper in the morning and
it says a new fibre has made finer lingerie possible.
I don’t use lingerie. Further on, there’s something
else about floor stains. That lacks the personal
appeal. So does the one about candies. My
digestion’s too poor for candies. Then I come across
‘Buy Jones’s Razors.’ I don’t buy Jones’s razors.
Perhaps my man buys them. I don’t know. But
you see how it is. Everywhere one goes these things
hit the retina. There’s no escape from this modern
way of pushing things. My own company does it.
I get tired of it. I want to forget Jones’s razors, and
Smith’s Confected Candies, and . . . and . . .
dollars, and cents, and the whole twentieth century. I
want to blot it all out of my mind. I want to get
among old things, things that were made long before
dollars were thought of. That’s restful. That’s the
kind of thing I like. Something that looks as if
your Queen Elizabeth might have used it, or one
of your Henries. If it’s got a history attached to it,
I like it all the more.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent’s face showed a blend of sympathy and
amusement.</p>

<p>“So <em>that’s</em> how you became a collector?”</p>

<p>Wraxall smiled also.</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Brent, that’s part of the truth. That
certainly is a factor. But there’s more to it than
that. You may laugh at me if you like. You may
certainly laugh. But I love these old things for
themselves. It gives me a real pleasure to handle
them, just to turn them over and over and look at
them. And to wonder about the people who wore
them. These things mean more to me than all the
history-books. Much more.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent’s white-framed face became more
sympathetic. She recognised a kindred spirit in the
American, although his line of escape from the
modern world was not the same as her own.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to see the Dangerfield Talisman
before you go, Mr. Wraxall. They’ll be glad to show
it to you and tell you the legend. There are some
photographs of it, too. You might be able to take
one of them back for your collection.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wraxall brushed the suggestion aside.</p>

<p>“Photographs would be no use to me. They
haven’t the appeal. No.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment; then, studying her face,
he continued:</p>

<p>“I thought of taking the thing itself back with me
in the fall, if it could be arranged.”</p>

<p>“The Dangerfield Talisman?” Mrs. Brent almost
lost her manners in her astonishment. “You thought
of taking that back with you! Why, the thing’s
absurd. They’d sooner part with Friocksheim than
with the Talisman; and they’ve held Friocksheim
since before the Conquest.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t stick at a few thousand pounds one
way or the other. I’d set my heart on getting that
Talisman. I’ve come four thousand miles for it,
specially. That shows I’m interested. I’m keenly
interested. I’m not a bargainer. They’ve only to
name their price and I’ll pay it.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear man, this isn’t a case where money
comes in at all, don’t you see? The thing’s
unbuyable, you may take my word for it.”</p>

<p>The American scanned her face carefully.</p>

<p>“I see you mean it,” he commented, “but I came
here specially to procure that Talisman. I couldn’t
be content to take your word for it. Maybe you’re
right. Perhaps you know best. But I’ll have to
go to headquarters with my offer and make sure.
I’m not doubting what you say. Not at all. I
hadn’t a notion there was any difficulty in the road.
None at all. But you’ll understand that, without
doubting what you say in the very least, I’ve got to
make sure?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent had recovered from her astonishment.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly, go ahead. I shan’t feel offended,
if that’s what you mean. But I warn you that it’s
quite useless—out of the question.”</p>

<p>The American made a non-committal gesture.
Mrs. Brent thought it best to change the subject.</p>

<p>“This heat seems to be getting worse, if anything.
I must really get a fan. I’m old-fashioned enough
to have one.”</p>

<p>She rose and left the room. Wraxall transferred
his interest to his host who was still gazing absently
out over the gardens. Mrs. Brent’s evident
amazement at his suggestion had given the American
something to think about. Things were not going to
be so simple as he had imagined. He glanced across
at Rollo Dangerfield’s profile, trying to estimate the
chances of overcoming his objections if he really
proved obdurate.</p>

<p>“Why, he might be an old Norseman come to life,”
Wraxall said to himself. “Put one of those winged
helmets on his head, and with that profile and that
big white moustache he could sit to any painter for
the portrait of a Viking. He’s not likely to be
anybody’s money when it comes to bargaining.
Stubborn. Obstinate. It’s going to be none so easy
after all.”</p>

<p>He studied his host covertly until he was
interrupted by Mrs. Brent’s return. She slipped into her
chair and began to fan herself with an air of relief.</p>

<p>“This is the kind of night when one appreciates
the Dangerfield methods,” she said, after a time.
“They know how I hate climbing stairs; and they
gave me a room on the ground floor. It’s the only
one; all the rest are above. I blessed them just
now as I passed the staircase and remembered that
I might have had to climb it. I’ve got to the age
when one economises on the unnecessary as far as
possible; and I count stair climbing as a luxury on
that standard.”</p>

<p>A great moth swept suddenly in through the open
window, veered and swerved blindly over Rollo
Dangerfield’s head, and then blundered out once
more into the darkness. Mrs. Brent followed its
flight; and her eyes caught the sky beyond the
embrasure.</p>

<p>“Rollo!” she raised her voice to attract his
attention. “Is there any sign of that thunderstorm
breaking? I wish it would come, and perhaps the
air would clear a little after it.”</p>

<p>Old Dangerfield leaned forward a little and
scanned the visible horizon.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s no good. The clouds are lighter
than they were an hour ago; and I shouldn’t expect
it to break to-night now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent fanned herself resignedly.</p>

<p>“I’m not altogether sorry. That cure is almost as
bad as the disease for me, Mr. Wraxall. A
thunderstorm shakes my nerves to pieces always—I don’t
know why. I’m not afraid of being struck, or
anything of that kind; but the noise of thunder seems to
get down somewhere into my subconsciousness and
set me all on edge. After a real bad storm I’m
hardly normal. I feel I might do anything wild; try
to fly downstairs, steal my best friend’s spoons, or
something equally idiotic.”</p>

<p>The American looked at her with a faint twinkle
in his eye.</p>

<p>“Now that’s curious, Mrs. Brent, that’s very
curious indeed. For, you see, thunderstorms take me
quite the other way. I like them. I’d sit up all
night to watch a good thunderstorm. Give me a
chair, and a good wide window, with not too much
iron near it, and I’d be content to watch the flashes
so long as they like to come.”</p>

<p>He turned to the nearest window as he spoke, and
then seemed to study it for a moment or two.</p>

<p>“That kind of window wouldn’t be much use as a
stall for the performance. It’s too deep-set. Are
the walls of this house really a couple of yards thick,
the way they seem to be at the window-sill there?”</p>

<p>“Several feet thick in this part of Friocksheim.
This is the old part of the house, you know—some
of it dates from the time when the place was a
castle, and they had to make walls thick and
windows small. And of course that’s quite a recent
thing. Here and there about the building you’ll find
remnants of a much older Friocksheim. There’s a
gateway you must get the Dangerfields to show you.
It’s old enough to satisfy you, I should think.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see it. It would be very interesting
to me. And there must be some things worth
visiting in the neighbourhood too. Perhaps you could
tell me what I ought to go and see.”</p>

<p>“There’s a battered sort of monument on the road
to Frogsholme village, about a mile and a half from
here. I believe I remember hearing that it had
something to do with Runic, whatever that is. And
there are one or two other things you might care to
look at.”</p>

<p>For a time she gave him the benefit of her rather
scrappy knowledge of the local antiquities, while he
jotted down notes in his pocket-book. At last, when
he had exhausted her store, he looked at his watch
and made a gesture of apology.</p>

<p>“It’s late, Mrs. Brent. I really hadn’t meant to
keep you so long. But what you’ve been telling me
is interesting, and I’ve got a thirst for knowledge
about that kind of thing. You’ve helped me
considerably. That information will be of great assistance
to me.”</p>

<p>“Why not begin with the nearest? Mr.
Dangerfield will be delighted to show you the Talisman
to-night, I’m sure, if you wish it. And be sure to get
him to tell you the legend of the pool. It may save
you trouble, you know. You’ll see that your idea
about the Talisman is quite hopeless.”</p>

<p>“That’s an idea. That’s a good idea, Mrs. Brent.
I always like to know, right away, what sort of
proposition I’m up against. I’ve not given up hope
yet, you understand? I’m quite set on taking that
Talisman home with me somehow, if it can be
managed. And I think it can, one way or another.”</p>

<p>Conway Westenhanger’s voice came across the
room. The bridge-table was breaking up.</p>

<p>“I make it twenty-seven pounds twelve. You
might check the figures, Douglas. I’m more at home
in the calculus than in simple arithmetic; and it’s
quite likely I’ve made a slip.”</p>

<p>“Right,” said Douglas. “It isn’t your honesty
I’m in doubt about, merely your capacity. The
great brains are always a bit one-sided—top-heavy,
if you take my meaning. Let’s see. Eight and
six . . .”</p>

<p>He rapidly checked the addition.</p>

<p>“Correct! Well, you scrape through with a
caution this time; but don’t do it again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton produced a roll of notes and
counted out twenty-seven pounds ten on the table
between Eileen and herself.</p>

<p>“One moment. I have a florin somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble about it,” Eileen hastened to
reassure her. “You needn’t hunt for it. Let it
stand.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton continued her search and at
last discovered the missing coin.</p>

<p>“I don’t like letting things stand over. Settle for
cash, that’s always been my principle in bridge. I
can’t be worried with remembering odd shillings from
day to day.”</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage picked up her winnings gratefully.
She was not disturbed by Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s
manner. She was too overwhelmed by relief. Here
was an absolute windfall which would go some
distance towards solving the problem of her debts.
Twenty-seven pounds! And she had given only half
her attention to the game. If she had put her mind
to it they might have won a good deal more. She
had not even asked what stakes they were playing
for; she had been too worried to think about that.
A couple more nights like this and she would be able
to pay off all her creditors.</p>

<p>“Sorry I shan’t be able to give you your revenge
to-morrow, Douglas,” she heard Conway
Westenhanger say, as he rose from the table. “I’ve got to
run up to town for a couple of days. My
patent-agent seems to have got on the track of an
infringement of one of my affairs, and he wants to go into the
business. That means Chancery Lane, Patent Office
Library, and all the rest of it. Whew! It will be
hot!”</p>

<p>Douglas’s good-natured face corrugated in a grin
of commiseration; but already he was moving across
the room to where Cynthia Pennard was sitting.
Morchard watched his coming with a discontented
eye.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent, glad to be relieved from the
American’s inquisition on local monuments, went across to
Rollo Dangerfield’s chair and gazed out of the
window.</p>

<p>“No, that storm won’t break to-night, I’m afraid.
It’s moved further on. But it’s got on my nerves
already. I wish it would break and get the thing over.
This heat wave might pass, then.”</p>

<p>She drew back from the embrasure and bent over
old Dangerfield.</p>

<p>“Rollo! I think Mr. Wraxall would like to have a
look at the Talisman to-night, if you aren’t too
tired.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield heaved himself up out of his
chair, his six-foot height overtopping Mrs. Brent’s
slight figure as he rose.</p>

<p>“Certainly, if Mr. Wraxall wishes it. We can go
along now, if he cares about it.”</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage had caught the rapid interchange
of talk.</p>

<p>“Oh! Are you going to tell him the Legend?
May I come? I’d like to hear it.”</p>

<p>“What legend? About the Talisman? I haven’t
heard it either,” said Westenhanger. “Do you mind
my coming with you along with the rest?”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield’s smile had a touch of
wistfulness, in which it seemed curiously alien from the
general cast of his features.</p>

<p>“Anyone who is interested will be welcome,” he
said, with a touch of an old-fashioned courtesy which
seemed to be so much in character in his case. And,
crossing the room, he opened the door for the party to
pass out under his guidance.</p>

<h2>Chapter II</h2>

<p>The group of Rollo Dangerfield’s followers
diminished as it passed along the corridor. At the
main entrance, Douglas and Cynthia slipped aside
and went off by themselves down the broad steps into
the gardens. Further on, beyond the great staircase,
Mrs. Brent bade her companions good-night and
turned into her room. Only five of his guests were
left to follow the old man to the end of the corridor,
where he threw open an unlocked door.</p>

<p>“This is what we call the Corinthian’s Room,” he
explained as he ushered them into it. “It was my
grandfather’s favourite spot in the house, and it got
its name from him. He was one of the Regency
bucks—no worse than the rest of them, perhaps, but
a hard liver and a hard gambler in his day. An
eccentric, too, like most of them. I can show you one
of his eccentricities in a moment, if you care to
see it.”</p>

<p>The room was about forty feet square, with a huge
stone fireplace. A great cupboard of oak occupied
part of one wall. Another wall was hung with an
aged tapestry representing Diana pursuing a stag.
The floor was of marble slabs, mainly white; but in
the centre, black squares of marble had been
introduced so as to make a gigantic chess-board pattern.
Opposite the fireplace was a narrow and shallow
niche filled with a glass case.</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield switched on the electric lights
and led the visitors towards the recess. As they
came near it, they saw within the case a bell of
faintly tinted glass, under which lay, on a velvet
bed, an ancient ornament.</p>

<p>“That is the Dangerfield Talisman,” said old
Rollo, pointing to the case. “You can see what it is:
one of those golden armlets which were worn in the
olden times. It’s too heavy for our modern tastes,
I’m afraid. You would hardly care to carry that,
Miss Cressage.”</p>

<p>He turned to Eileen with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“It’s very heavy for an ornament—something
over a pound, I believe,” he went on, as his guests
drew nearer to look closely at the jewel. “Of course,
the value of the gold is nothing to speak of, perhaps
under a hundred pounds. The stones are of more
interest in some people’s eyes. There are eight of
them in all—you can see the others reflected in the
mirror at the back, if you look closely.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton examined the Talisman with
an appraising eye.</p>

<p>“I agree with you. It’s too heavy in the design.”</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage bent forward and seemed to
compare the size of the ornament with her own white
arm.</p>

<p>“If a girl wore that,” she said, “she must have
been splendid. It’s not a bit clumsy. She must
have been slim, if anything, with small hands, or she
couldn’t have got it over them.”</p>

<p>“Let’s try it on Miss Cressage,” said Morchard,
suddenly, and he moved forward as he spoke. The
case had a plain sheet of glass immediately in front
of the jewel, through which it could be examined,
whilst at either side was a glass door kept secured
by a tiny handle. As Morchard put out his hand,
Rollo Dangerfield stopped him with a gesture.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said, “but it’s one of our family
customs never to take the Talisman out of its
case—never even to lift the shade from it.”</p>

<p>He smiled, faintly apologetic, but evidently
unbending in defence of his traditions.</p>

<p>“These ideas grow up somehow, in ways that are
difficult to trace back to their births; but as time
goes on, they gain a sort of sanctity from tradition,
and speaking for myself, I should be sorry if I were
the first of us to break this particular custom.
There are so few of the old things left in this
twentieth century world, and perhaps you young people
won’t grudge me this one, if I keep it.”</p>

<p>The touch of wistfulness had come back into his
voice, robbing his refusal of the faintest trace of
offence. Eileen, afraid that some of the others
might embarrass the old man by pressing him to
let them handle the jewel, hastened to put in a word
before Morchard could open his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’d love to try it on; but what Mr. Dangerfield
says is quite right. And now, I’d like to hear its
story—the legend, I mean.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield silently invited them to seat
themselves. Then, leaning against the case
containing the Talisman, he turned to face his audience
and began to speak. At first he seemed nervous of
his effect; but as the tale went on, his voice changed
into a monotone, as though he were reciting some
well-remembered ritual.</p>

<p>“You must bear in mind that this is a very old
tale, far older than any written document that we
have. True enough, it fits the geography of
Friocksheim; but for all we know, the legend may be far
older than Friocksheim and may deal with some
Pool which none of us has ever seen. You know
that we Dangerfields came into England from the
North, away back in the troubled days before the
Conquest. Friocksheim, I’m told, is a corruption
of Fricca’s Heim, Frea’s Heim, the dwelling of
Frea, the wife of Odin. There is no doubt about us
as a race.”</p>

<p>He lifted his old head proudly, and the Viking
resemblance stood out undeniably in his features.
Then, with a smile that showed the strong white
teeth, he added:</p>

<p>“I needn’t emphasise the final stage in the corruption
of the name as you find it in the village: our
Friocksheim has changed to Frogsholme, on the lips
of these godless aborigines.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment and shifted his position
slightly, so that he could see the Talisman as it lay
under his arm.</p>

<p>“You must understand, then,” he went on, “that
this legend comes down to us from days when
Valhalla still opened its gates to the heroes; and the
spirits of winds, and woods, and streams, moved
among men in their visible forms. It may be mere
allegory; possibly it is the transmutation of some
quite normal happening, a love tale magnified and
distorted in the telling.</p>

<p>“One summer’s night, the legend runs, Ulric, the
Lord of Friocksheim, went out into the moonlight,
seeking coolness after the heat of his castle walls.
And, so wandering, he came by the Pool and sat
beside the water, watching the rising of the mist from
the surface of the mere. As he sat thus, lost in
thought, the moonlight sparkled upon something
before him, and, bending forward, he grasped the
Talisman. So he sat, with the armlet in his hand;
and as he watched, the mists of the lake grew denser
and drew closer; and there stepped at last from
among their folds a maiden.”</p>

<p>Old Rollo bent towards the Talisman, so that his
face was partly hidden from his audience.</p>

<p>“Very little has come down to us—only a few
words in a tale. Yet even these halting words
conjure up for me a wonder; a being, young, and proud,
and fair, a form and grace surpassing all the beauty
of women; a flash of divinity passing across the
screen of the flesh.”</p>

<p>He let his voice drop into silence for a moment
before he continued:</p>

<p>“The legend tells that she was betrothed to the
Spirit of the Pool, the Frog King. But Ulric won
her. She gave him the Talisman which she had
come back to seek; and, when he desired her, he had
but to dip it in the Pool and she came to him—for
so long as that moon still shone. And she charged
him, when she was with him, to keep the Talisman
and to hand it down; for it would be the Luck of
Friocksheim. And so, night after night, the Lord of
Friocksheim went down to the Pool and washed the
Talisman in its waters and wandered with his love in
the wood beside the mere—until the moon came no
more over the trees. But the next night, when he
dipped the Talisman in the waters, there came
swimming to him a loathsome little shape which laughed
and jeered at him, saying: ‘The Frog King has her
for his bride.’ ”</p>

<p>Old Rollo turned back towards his audience again.</p>

<p>“So the Dangerfield Talisman is only a reminder
of an old lie. Even at the best, it’s a memorial of
lying and deceit—and punishment.”</p>

<p>His voice sounded bitter for a moment, but he
went back at once to his ordinary tone:</p>

<p>“There it is: the Dangerfield Luck. I don’t say
I believe the legend; I won’t say I doubt it.
However the thing came to us, it’s our oldest possession
and experts tell me that the workmanship is
extraordinarily old. And now, I think I can show you
something less romantic, though it’s not without its
interest.”</p>

<p>He moved forward and pushed aside some rugs
with his foot, so that the black and white marble
squares in the centre of the floor were cleared.</p>

<p>“I told you, I think, that this was the room mainly
used by my grandfather, the Corinthian. It was, in
fact, the very last room he ever entered. Possibly
some of you remember something about the Regency
times, the gambling, the prize-fighting, the duelling
that went on. Eccentricity was often the pass-key
to notoriety in those days; some of the bucks
cultivated it wilfully. I believe that my grandfather was
genuinely eccentric in this particular affair. He was
a fanatic for chess playing and this was his chess
board. You see the marble squares on the floor.”</p>

<p>He stooped down and lifted a metal plug from
the centre of a square.</p>

<p>“Each of these squares has a plug like this at its
centre. They’re really put in to keep dirt out of the
holes when no game is being played. When they
wanted to set the pieces, all the plugs were taken out;
and then the board was ready.”</p>

<p>He stepped across the room and threw open the
oaken cupboard on the wall.</p>

<p>“These are the chess-men. You see they are on
a scale to match the board, each of them about a
foot and a half high. Mr. Westenhanger, would you
mind lifting one of them out—a pawn will do.
They’re too heavy for me, nowadays.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger came forward and gripped one of
the iron pieces.</p>

<p>“Lift it up off the shelf before you pull it
forward,” said old Dangerfield. “There’s a spike on
the foot of each piece, fitting into a hole in the
shelf—the spike that goes into the hole in the
chess-board, so that the piece can’t be accidentally knocked
over. They’re top-heavy things. The Staunton
pattern wasn’t invented in those days.”</p>

<p>It took more effort than Westenhanger had
expected to lift the thing from its place and carry it
over to the chess-board. He dropped it into
position on one of the squares, the iron rod slipping
easily into the hole and fixing the piece firmly.</p>

<p>“Rather like a railway chess-board, isn’t it?” he
said, as he went back to his seat, “but a good deal of
trouble to play a game with pieces of that weight,
I should think.”</p>

<p>Old Rollo’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>“I doubt if they’d have played much if they’d
been left to their own exertions. As a matter of
fact, each player had a lackey to shift his pieces for
him while he sat comfortably in his chair.”</p>

<p>He came forward and sat down as he spoke.</p>

<p>“This chess-board looks innocent enough; but it
brought the death of my grandfather. You know
what it was like in those days: men would quarrel
about the tint of a snuff-box and fight a fatal duel
over the fit of a cravat. My grandfather was as
much of a fire-eater as his friends. Some miserable
squabble took place in this room while they were
actually playing on that board; probably a mere
drunken difference of opinion about some absurd
trifle or other. They went out with pistols in the
dawn; and the other man was the luckier of the
two. Perhaps he deserved to be. No one knows
now what they fought about. My grandfather was
shot in the head—killed instantly.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield rose, and drawing from his
pocket a bunch of keys, he opened a small safe
buried in the wall of the room beside the
fireplace. From one of the divisions of the safe he
extracted a worn-looking paper and a peculiar disc-like
object.</p>

<p>“Here are two other relics. We preserve most
things; and as this was the last document my
grandfather put on paper, we’ve kept it in safety. You
may as well see it.”</p>

<p>He handed the paper to Wraxall, who studied it
intently before passing it to his neighbour. At the
top of the sheet were two lines of handwriting:</p>

<blockquote class="document original">

  <p>Nox Nocti Indicat Scientiam.</p>
  <p>Matt VI. 21; Luke XII. 34.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Below this was a rough diagram of a chess-board
with certain pieces placed as in an end-game or a
problem.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/diagram1.jpg" alt="A chess-board diagram.

five pawns and the queen. Neither player is in check; however, the
Black king cannot move, being surrounded by its own pieces as well as
a White bishop.">
</figure>

<p>Wraxall turned the paper over in search of
something further; but the back of the sheet was blank.</p>

<p>The American passed the manuscript to Mrs.
Caistor Scorton and held out his hand for the
second object which Rollo Dangerfield had taken from
the safe. It was a circular disc cut from a sheet of
leather. Originally the sheet may have been the
same thickness as a boot-sole, or rather thinner; but
a century of atmospheric changes had warped and
contorted its form. Evidently when new it had been
about two and a half inches in diameter. Through
the centre of the leather there passed a piece of
twine secured on one side of the disc by a knot and
looped on the other side into a fixed ringlet of a size
which would just admit a hand. Wraxall turned the
object over and over, but it suggested nothing to him.
After a final inspection, he passed it also to his
neighbour, and then turned inquiringly to Rollo
Dangerfield.</p>

<p>“It suggests nothing to you?” old Dangerfield
demanded perfunctorily. He took back both objects
after they had been examined by everyone, and held
up the paper so that they could see it. “This first
line, in Latin, is simply part of the second verse of
the Nineteenth Psalm: <i>Night unto night sheweth
knowledge.</i> The two references to the Gospels give
you the verse: <i>Where your treasure is, there will
your heart be also.</i> I am afraid we can’t discover
anything from that part of the document. The rest
of it seems easier to account for, if I tell you a little
more about the paper.”</p>

<p>He put the sheet on his knee and leaned back in
his chair as though tired.</p>

<p>“You see the rough sketch of the chess-board,”
he went on after a moment or two. “That gives the
position in which the pieces were found on this board
here after his death. Possibly it represents the
end-position in that game during which the quarrel
arose between him and his opponent. He must have
attached some importance to it himself, for he came
into this room just before going off to his duel, jotted
the thing down, and left orders that it was to be
given to his son if anything happened. That, I
must admit, seems to suggest that he was not quite
in a normal frame of mind when he put the thing on
paper; for at that date my father was a boy of four
or five years old. We Dangerfields are a very
late-marrying family, for some reason or other.
Obviously a child of that age could have no interest in
chess-endings. Put that together with the three
texts; and I believe the normal mind would say that
my grandfather’s brain was still bemused with his
night’s wine—he drank an enormous quantity of
port, they say—and that in a muddled-headed way
he scribbled down this end-game, added one or two
of his favourite texts, and then, with some idea that
the texts might be of service to his son, he left
directions for the paper to be handed on.”</p>

<p>He glanced amusedly round the circle to see if
they shared this view.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” he continued, “that explanation
falls short of completeness on one matter. This
little leather disc was also to be handed to my father.
Was it a toy that he had made for the boy?
Perhaps he had promised it to the child, and even at
that dangerous moment he remembered his promise?
I like to think that there was something of the kind
in his mind. But if there had been any promise of
the sort, my father had forgotten it. When they
questioned him he knew nothing about it. Quite
possibly it was a promised toy. You know what the
memory of a four-year-old is like and how difficult
it is to catch hold of something which he has once
allowed to slip. Nothing came of it.”</p>

<p>His fingers played almost affectionately with the
wrinkled scrap of leather.</p>

<p>“My grandfather’s death left my father an
orphan; for his mother had died a year or two earlier.
The paper was preserved and handed to my father,
when he came of age, by the lawyer of our family
who had impounded it shortly after its discovery.
It meant nothing to anyone. Whatever meaning it
carried had been lost. All that it meant to my
father was the last link with his Corinthian ancestor;
and I believed that he preserved it on that account.
At any rate, it found its way into the Dangerfield
archives, and there it is likely to remain.”</p>

<p>“And you, yourself, haven’t any idea about it,
Mr. Dangerfield?” asked Eileen. “Surely he must
have had something in his mind when he wrote it.
Tell us what you think of it, if you can.”</p>

<p>“I can give you a guess,” said old Dangerfield,
“but it’s a guess and nothing more. My own view
is that the quarrel had arisen over some question of
their play; and my grandfather wanted a permanent
record left, so as to be able to prove his point in cold
blood later on. In addition to being a gambler and
one of the most remarkable spendthrifts of his day,
he was an obstinate man. We know that to our cost.
The Dangerfield jewels used to be a very fine
collection; but after his death it was found that most of
the good things had vanished—converted into cash
and gambled away in backing that obstinate opinion
of his. After a couple of generations we’re still
suffering from the inroads he made into the estate.”</p>

<p>“Is anything more known about him?” asked
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“Not very much that’s creditable, I’m afraid.
Oh, yes! I believe that he made himself rather
ridiculous by an improvement of the hobby-horse.”</p>

<p>“He must have been a rum bird!” commented
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield hastened to explain.</p>

<p>“Not a rocking-horse. I mean that two-wheeled
thing like a safety bicycle that some of the
Corinthians used to amuse themselves with. One sat in the
saddle and pushed the thing along with one’s feet
on the ground—like running in a chair, rather. It
had a vogue at one time. I’m told that he brought
out a new pattern with treadles—something like the
present child’s scooter in principle. At any rate, it
was rather frowned on, and he was glad to let it
drop. But you see that he was evidently akin to you
on one side at least.”</p>

<p>“Now there’s just one other thing I’d like to hear
about, if you can tell us, Mr. Dangerfield.” Eileen
Cressage looked rather doubtfully at the old man as
she spoke. “Perhaps I’m indiscreet; and if I am,
please say so at once. People talk about the
Dangerfield Secret. They say it’s something like the one
in that Scots family up in the north—you know, the
thing the heir is told when he’s twenty-one. Is
there really a Dangerfield secret?”</p>

<p>Old Rollo Dangerfield’s face hardened perceptibly
for a moment; and he looked at the girl with an
inscrutable expression. Then, evidently reading in
her face a fear that she had offended him, he relaxed
his attitude slightly and tried to put her at her ease
again. Nevertheless, the tone of his voice was
sufficient to show that he disliked the subject.</p>

<p>“There is something which people call the
Dangerfield Secret. Helga doesn’t know it. She’ll be told
when she’s twenty-five. My nephew Eric knows it,
since he’s the next male heir. I can say no more
about it.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger relieved the slight strain that
followed by getting up and stepping across to the
Talisman’s case.</p>

<p>“I suppose you put this in the safe each night, Mr.
Dangerfield? It would hardly do to leave it exposed
like this for anyone to pick up. It must be worth
a small fortune.”</p>

<p>Old Dangerfield looked across the room.</p>

<p>“It was valued last in my grandfather’s time, and
they put it down as being worth some £50,000 then.
The diamonds were said to be very fine; and you can
see the size of the stones for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’d trust it in a small safe like that,
if it were mine,” said Westenhanger, glancing at the
little iron door from which Rollo Dangerfield had
taken the document. “Any man with a pocket
crowbar could open that thing and get away with the
Talisman.”</p>

<p>The old man laughed shortly.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble about the safe. The Talisman is
never put into that. The fact is, you have come up
against another of the Dangerfield superstitions.
The Talisman is never moved from its place by day
or night. It stands where you see it, always.”</p>

<p>The American sat up suddenly.</p>

<p>“You leave it there, sir? You take no
precautions against crooks? You don’t mean to tell me
anyone could step in here, lift that bell, and clear off
with the goods?”</p>

<p>He paused, as if struck by a thought. Then he
continued in another tone.</p>

<p>“I take it that you’re fully covered by insurance?”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield’s face took on a faintly sardonic
expression. He seemed to enjoy surprising the
American.</p>

<p>“Not at all. The Talisman has never been
insured. Why should we insure it? It always comes
back. We have electric alarms on all the outer doors
and the windows, of course; but they are merely put
on because my wife is nervous. The Talisman can
look after itself, I assure you.”</p>

<p>Wraxall looked at his host in amazement.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that?”</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, and then a fresh idea
seemed to strike him.</p>

<p>“Now I see! You’ve got some medieval
mantrap or spring-gun attached to the thing, something
that grips your burglar if he comes after your
property?”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield’s laugh was quite free from
sarcasm; he evidently enjoyed the jest which he alone
could see.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Wraxall, nary a spring-gun, as I believe
some of your compatriots might say. Not so much
as a mantrap. You could lift the thing from its bed
at any hour of the day or night without the slightest
risk. My nephew Eric has rooms in the tower above
us; but even if he heard you, I doubt if he would
trouble to interrupt you. We know our Talisman.
It always comes home.”</p>

<p>The American was plainly astounded.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Mr. Dangerfield, that you’re
presuming a good deal on your safety in the past.
Crooks nowadays aren’t likely to be frightened off
by talk. No, it would take more than a Castle
Spectre to keep some of our smashers out of here if
they only knew what you’ve told us.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield’s white eyebrows contracted
slightly. It was evident to them all that he was
displeased at being doubted. He leaned forward and
spoke directly to the American.</p>

<p>“Now this is authentic, Mr. Wraxall. You can
look up the accounts in the local papers of the time,
if you care to go to the trouble. I shall be very
pleased to give you the dates, if necessary. At least
twice within the last half century an attempt has
been made to rob us of the Talisman. Once a
drunken tramp made his way in here during the night
and took the armlet. He was afraid to get rid of
it anywhere near here; and three days later he was
arrested for some other crime; the Talisman was
found on him and returned to us. The second case
was a genuine burglary. One of the keepers saw the
man leave the house and gave chase. The fellow
dropped dead—heart failure, it was said to be—and
the Talisman was found in his hand.”</p>

<p>The American said nothing; but quite obviously
he was not convinced. Old Dangerfield seemed to
be nettled.</p>

<p>“I am not trying to convince you, Mr. Wraxall.
I suppose that would be quite impossible. But I tell
you this frankly: If the Talisman disappeared
to-night, the last thing I should think of doing would be
to call in the police. The Talisman guards itself.
Within seven days at the outside, it would be back
there under the bell.”</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage had been listening eagerly to the
old man’s words; but at this last statement, her
surprise broke out.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t call in the police, Mr. Dangerfield?
You’d really trust to the Talisman finding its way
home? It seems amazing.”</p>

<p>“You may take me at my word, Miss Cressage.
I mean exactly what I say in this matter. If the
Talisman disappeared, either by day or by night,
I should not trouble to call in police assistance.
Why should I, when I know what I do know? Of
course I mean what I say. Did you ever see
anything like the Talisman guarded with so little care?
If I did not believe implicitly that it would come
back, wouldn’t I have it trenched round with all
manner of protections? Of course! Let it go!
What does that matter, since it is certain to be over
there again before long.”</p>

<p>Conway Westenhanger turned from the Talisman’s
niche, but as he crossed the tessellated floor his eye
was caught by something which he had not noticed
before. He stooped for an instant and glanced
keenly at the corners of one or two squares.</p>

<p>“Something there that’s got plugged with dirt,”
he reflected. “Holes a bit bigger than a large pin’s
head, they seem to be. Nothing important,
evidently, since they’re choked up in that fashion.”</p>

<h2>Chapter III</h2>

<p>Freddie Stickney owed his presence in the
Friocksheim house-party to qualities other than those
which make a welcome guest. He was a mean little
man, with a skin which invariably proved itself
impenetrable to ordinary social pin-pricks; and this
thickness of hide enabled him to thrust himself into
positions wherein an average individual would have
felt too keenly that he was an intruder. He had
invited himself, knowing Rollo Dangerfield’s dislike
for hurting people’s feelings and counting on that
quality to avoid a refusal; and, having arrived, he
proposed to stay for just as long as it suited him to
do so. Not that he had any special interest in the
Dangerfields. He had angled for three other
invitations before turning to Friocksheim as a last
resource. However, he was quite prepared to make
the most of it, now that he had fixed the thing up.
“Even the best of us,” he reflected philosophically,
“even the best of us have to put up with the
second-best at times.” And in this kindly spirit he had
come down from town.</p>

<p>Freddie’s lack of popularity was due to certain
peculiarities in his mind. An acquaintance of his,
hard put to it to account for the matter, had
explained it thus: “Freddie’s got a certain acuteness.
Give him a fact, and he’ll worry at it and draw
inferences from it. And the funny thing is that every
inference he draws tends to discredit somebody or
something. And yet he doesn’t do it out of malice.
It’s just Freddie’s way. He’s got that kind of
mind—can’t help making people uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day after Rollo
Dangerfield had shown the Talisman to his guests, Freddie
was lounging on a seat in the garden when one of
these inference-bearing facts crossed his mind.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said to himself, “now that
Westenhanger’s gone to town, we shall be thirteen at table
to-night. That’s very thoughtless of the
Dangerfields. Out of thirteen people there’s certain to be
at least one person who’s superstitious. That’ll be
most uncomfortable for everybody. I think I’d
better mention it before we sit down.”</p>

<p>As it chanced he had not to wait so long before
announcing his discovery. Before he had finished a
mental analysis of the probable distribution of
superstition among his fellow-guests, Mrs. Dangerfield
came into view, armed with gloves and scissors.
Freddie rose and joined her.</p>

<p>“Going to cut some flowers?” he inquired. “May
I help?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dangerfield refused his assistance; but
Freddie was not to be shaken off.</p>

<p>“Friend of mine once suffered badly. Tore his
finger with a thorn, then let some dirt into it.
Careless fellow he was, poor chap. It suppurated,
swelled up, they had to take the finger off at last.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dangerfield deliberately put on her gardening
gloves.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall run much risk in these, Mr.
Stickney.”</p>

<p>“No? Perhaps not. Still, one never can tell, you
know. A single prick from a rose-thorn would be
enough.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dangerfield laughed.</p>

<p>“You must be a terribly thoughtful person to live
with.”</p>

<p>Freddie considered this for a moment.</p>

<p>“No. Just a knack I have of seeing a thing and
knowing how it happens. That reminds me—we
shall be thirteen at table to-night. Don’t mind
myself, of course—and I’m sure you don’t mind
either—but some of the people might, you know. It’s
awkward.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t trouble about it, Mr. Stickney. As
a matter of fact, I remembered it yesterday and rang
up Mrs. Tuxford. She and the doctor will dine with
us to-night. So no one’s feelings will be ruffled.
And of course we never have a full party at lunch.
Is your mind relieved?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dangerfield did not like Freddie Stickney.</p>

<p>“But what about breakfast to-morrow?” pursued
the indefatigable inquirer. “They might happen to
turn up all at the same time.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brent always breakfasts in her own room,”
said Mrs. Dangerfield, who was tired of the subject.
“I’m sorry. I have some orders to give to this
gardener.”</p>

<p>Dismissed in this summary fashion Freddie
Stickney wandered about the grounds until it was time
to go into the house and dress. He was feeling
rather bored. Friocksheim might be cheaper than
the Continent, but undeniably it was slow. Nothing
happened at Friocksheim. These people seemed to
have no interest in scandal. He began to wish that
something would turn up to liven things a little. He
had had hopes of Morchard at first. The
mottle-faced fellow seemed to be keen on the girls; and
anything might turn up. But none of the girls
seemed interested in Morchard. Nor did they seem
fascinated by Freddie himself. A slow place,
decidedly slow. He was thoughtful while he dressed.
If the Dangerfield circle was going to turn out so
boring he might be forced to leave earlier than he had
intended; but that would mean paying hotel bills
somewhere, and Freddie’s frugal mind could hardly
bring itself to consider that prospect except as a last
resort.</p>

<p>After dinner the party split up. Douglas
Fairmile, complaining bitterly of the heat and clamouring
for fresh air, easily persuaded Cynthia to follow him
out into the gardens. Old Dangerfield impressed
Freddie Stickney to make up a bridge four with Nina
Lindale and the doctor’s wife. As they sat down
Mrs. Tuxford put in a plea for small stakes.</p>

<p>“What do you call ‘small stakes?’ ” demanded
Freddie. “As low as ten bob a hundred? They’re
playing their usual points at the other table, I think.”</p>

<p>He glanced over his shoulder as he spoke, and
noted that Mrs. Caistor Scorton and Morchard were
playing against Eric Dangerfield and Eileen.</p>

<p>The doctor’s wife, a shy-looking girl, seemed taken
aback by Freddie’s ideas.</p>

<p>“I simply can’t afford to play for anything higher
than a shilling a hundred,” she said, ignoring
Freddie’s ill-suppressed astonishment at the figure. “I’m
sorry, but there it is.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield winced under Freddie’s
tactlessness. He knew that the doctor’s practice was a very
small one; and he admired the girl for having the
grit to keep the stakes down.</p>

<p>“Quite right,” he interjected, swiftly, before
Freddie could say anything further, “I agree with you,
Mrs. Tuxford. A shilling a hundred suits well
enough if one’s keen on the game for its own sake.
I’d much rather play with people who want to win
a rubber than with other people who only want to
win a sovereign.”</p>

<p>“I’m quite pleased to play for a shilling a
hundred,” said Nina Lindale.</p>

<p>Freddie could take a hint as well as most people.
His eyes opened a little wider, but nothing else
showed whether he was pleased or displeased. As
the game began, the doctor came across the room
and glanced at his wife’s hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent, feeling the thunderous closeness of the
night, had made her way to a chair beside one of the
deep windows; and leaning back in it she tried to
persuade herself that she felt a breath of cooler air.
Wraxall and Mrs. Dangerfield followed her, and they
were joined almost immediately by the doctor.
Helga Dangerfield circled round the two tables,
halting for a moment or two to scan the cards. Then,
saying she had some letters to write, she left the
room.</p>

<p>“The storm must be coming to-night,” Mrs. Brent
asserted, as a faint puff of sultry air momentarily
stirred the curtain beside her. “It’s been banking
up all day; and I’m sure it can’t keep off much
longer. I can feel all my nerves atwitch.”</p>

<p>Wraxall bent forward in his chair and scanned the
heavy clouds.</p>

<p>“I’m not up in your weather-signs,” he said, “but
it does seem to me that there’s a shake-up coming.
I should certainly judge we’d have rain soon. I
should say we’re in for a regular water-spout if those
clouds burst overhead. It will be wet.”</p>

<p>The doctor was examining Mrs. Brent’s face with
an interest more friendly than professional.</p>

<p>“Nerves?” he asked kindly.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“A dose of bromide? Quieten them, and give you
a chance to get to sleep. I can take my car down
and make it up for you in ten minutes, if you’d
like it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent thanked him with a smile; but she
nodded dissent to his suggestion.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “I don’t believe in running
away from things. I loathe thunder; but I’m not so
feeble as all that. I’d much rather take it as it
comes.”</p>

<p>The doctor was about to say something when she
stopped him with a gesture and bent forward to the
window, listening intensely.</p>

<p>“What bird was that?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I heard nothing,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she motioned for silence, and they sat
with ears strained. “There! Didn’t you hear it?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing,” said the American.</p>

<p>“There it is again!” Mrs. Brent held up her hand
for a moment. “It’s stopped now. Didn’t you hear
it, Anne?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dangerfield shook her head.</p>

<p>“You always forget that the rest of us aren’t gifted
with super-normal hearing, you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I heard it quite distinctly. It’s down
yonder in the trees near the Pool, I think.”</p>

<p>“Nobody else heard it, at any rate,” said the
doctor. “You must have remarkably sharp ears, Mrs.
Brent. Now I begin to see why you dislike thunder
so much. It must be a perfect torture to a person
with your acute hearing. I withdraw my suggestion
about a sedative. Nothing short of morphia would
keep you asleep in a storm, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Well, I haven’t come to that yet,” Mrs. Brent
retorted. “And I prefer to keep what nerves I have,
rather than wreck them further with drugs. One
can always stand a thing if one makes up one’s mind
to it.”</p>

<p>“One thing I won’t stand,” said Mrs. Dangerfield,
“and that’s the heat in this room. Let’s go outside
and see if we can’t find a cooler spot to sit.”</p>

<p>The doctor rose and followed her as she crossed
the room; but Mrs. Brent seemed to reject the idea.
She remained in her chair and Wraxall, after rising,
sat down again. For a time Mrs. Brent remained
silent, gazing out at the inky sky; but at last she
turned to the American.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Wraxall,” she demanded in a low voice
which could not reach the bridge players. “Are you
still confident of getting what you want?”</p>

<p>The American’s face betrayed nothing of his
thoughts.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say. No, it’s too early yet to say.
I’ll admit that it’s a stiffer thing than I expected.
It’s certainly stiffer than I supposed. But I haven’t
tried to get it yet. I think I’ll wait till I have tried,
before I say what I think. But I thank you for
what you told me. I take that kindly of you. If
you’d said nothing I’d have made a mistake, likely
enough. I hadn’t quite a grip of the situation; I’ll
say that frankly.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent scanned his imperturbable features for
a moment and then changed the subject.</p>

<p>“Rather a contrast between those two
bridge-tables over there. Mrs. Tuxford plays well; but she
kept the stakes down. The play at the other table
seems to me little better than gambling. I’ve heard
‘Re-double’ twice in the last round or two; and Miss
Cressage isn’t half as good at bridge as Mrs.
Tuxford.”</p>

<p>Wraxall looked at her with a faint admiration
showing on his face.</p>

<p>“You don’t miss much, Mrs. Brent. That’s a fact.
I’ve been watching them play, but it hadn’t struck
me. You’re quite right. But I suppose they can
stand it.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. No business of mine,” retorted
Mrs. Brent, shortly.</p>

<p>She turned slightly round in her chair, however,
and studied the faces of the players at Eileen’s table.
Things were going very badly for the girl. She
was the worst of the four, and in addition, her nerve
was going, and her play was growing more and more
reckless. That night she had sat down with the
pleasant feeling that in an hour or two she would
have won something more towards the payment of
these bills which still hung over her. But somehow,
this evening, things were different. Instead of
Conway Westenhanger, she had Eric Dangerfield as a
partner; and without quite realising what the change
meant she had found that the games did not run
so smoothly as they had done on the night before.
Once or twice she had miscalculated, and her partner
had left her to fend for herself. A run of bad cards
had eaten still further into her nerve.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, she had realised how much
she had already lost; and she had begun to play
more wildly in the hope of recouping herself. The
gains of the previous evening were gone by now,
and she was steadily running up a score against
herself. She began to feel the heat of the night; and
her play became more erratic.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent studied her face for a round or two
without comment. Then she turned to the American
with an expression which might almost have been an
ill-concealed sneer.</p>

<p>“If either of us was a philanthropist, Mr. Wraxall,
I think we could find a field for our talents by
persuading that girl to stop before she makes matters
worse. She’s making a fool of herself.”</p>

<p>“I judge so from her looks. I don’t play bridge.
It seems to me to lack the complete psychological
satisfaction that poker gives. And it hasn’t the
swiftness of faro. It’s too slow and not brainy
enough. I regard it as a dud game.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent turned her back to the bridge-table.</p>

<p>“Well, if we worried ourselves about other people’s
troubles we should have a full life of it,” she said.
“As I told you the other night, I’m not a professing
philanthropist.”</p>

<p>The American made no direct reply.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a headache?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Frightful. It’s the storm, I think.”</p>

<p>“I judged so from your eyes. If you’ll excuse me,
I’ll go off and leave you. You won’t be anxious to
talk when you feel that way.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent gloomily acquiesced. Wraxall rose
from his chair and left the room. As soon as he had
gone she turned again slightly and resumed her study
of Eileen Cressage’s face. The girl was evidently
slipping into desperation; and her play had
degenerated into mere gambling on long chances. Once
or twice she won heavily; but the run of luck was
persistently against her. Mrs. Brent shifted her
attention to Eric Dangerfield’s face; and from it she
could learn that he was growing uneasy. Once or
twice he endeavoured to take the play out of his
partner’s hands; but he had nothing like the skill of
Conway Westenhanger. More often than not, his
attempts at rescue ended in worse disaster.
Occasionally he glanced at the score and knitted his
brows; but his play continued steady. He had not
lost his nerve, like the girl.</p>

<p>After a final disastrous round, the bridge-party
completed the rubber and came to a close. Mrs.
Brent saw Eileen Cressage lean over and watch
Morchard as he added up the long array of figures;
and the girl’s perturbation at the sight of the
scoring-block was written plainly in her face. Morchard was
slow in arithmetic; and as he laboriously totted up
column after column, the distress deepened and the
girl went whiter. At last he jotted down the total
and worked out the cash equivalent.</p>

<p>“That’s—let’s see—two hundred and six pounds
eighteen, isn’t it?” he said, putting down the
scoring-block and pencil.</p>

<p>“What did you say? I didn’t quite catch,” said
Eileen. Two hundred pounds! She knew they had
been losing steadily; but this was far beyond her
worst anticipations. She couldn’t possibly pay that,
even if she were given a year to do it. What had
persuaded her to play at all? She felt her throat
dry and mechanically moistened her lips.</p>

<p>“Two hundred and six pounds eighteen, I make
it,” repeated Morchard. “Not bad, partner.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton glanced keenly at the girl’s
face.</p>

<p>“Well!” she said, shortly, pushing her chair back
slightly as though to show that the time had come
to settle.</p>

<p>Eileen pulled herself together with an effort.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I haven’t enough money to pay just
now,” she said. “I suppose you won’t mind letting
it stand over for a little?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton brought her eyes back to
Eileen’s face. Her thin lips were compressed for a
moment; and when she spoke, her voice was hard:</p>

<p>“I always settle my own bridge-debts
immediately; and I expect other people to do the same.”</p>

<p>Eileen flushed. After all, she had had fair
warning. Mrs. Caistor Scorton had said the same thing
the night before, when she had been the loser.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I haven’t as much money as that
on hand.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton reflected for a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, you can give me a cheque, if you like,”
she conceded. “But, frankly, I prefer to keep these
things on a cash basis always. It’s a fad of mine;
and I don’t like to break my rule.”</p>

<p>The ungraciousness of the tone was evident; but
Eileen cared little for that. All she wanted was to
escape the humiliation of a public explanation. A
cheque would furnish a way out of present
difficulties. She could hand it over; and then, later on,
she could explain the state of affairs to her creditor
without an embarrassing audience.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment and I’ll get my cheque-book,”
she said, rising from her chair. As she turned, she
noticed Morchard’s eyes fixed upon her and there
seemed to be something speculative in his gaze. In
his glance she read that he understood the state of
affairs perfectly; but she saw no sign of sympathy
in his face. Instead, there seemed to be calculation.</p>

<p>She climbed the great staircase, traversed the
long corridor which ran at the back of the main
building, and turned down the passage leading to
her own room in the rear of the house. In a moment
or two she had found her cheque-book, scribbled a
cheque, and was back in the drawing-room. So
eager was she to avoid an argument in public that
she hardly gave a thought to the possible results of
her action.</p>

<p>“£206 18s.—is that right?” she asked, passing the
slip of paper across to Mrs. Caistor Scorton.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scorton picked up the cheque, glanced at its
face to make sure that it was in order, and then put
it away. Eric Dangerfield watched her, with an
uncomfortable expression, then he turned to his other
opponent:</p>

<p>“Give you a cheque, if you don’t mind, Morchard,”
he said. “I’ll let you have it to-night or
to-morrow—now, if you’re anxious.”</p>

<p>Morchard was still studying Eileen’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, any time will do,” he said, absently.
“There’s no hurry.”</p>

<p>The second bridge-table completed a rubber and
the players rose from their seats. Mrs. Brent, in
her turn, left her chair and approached the group.</p>

<p>“I think it’s growing closer every minute,” she
said. “Would anyone care to walk in the gardens
for a while? I’m going out.”</p>

<p>Morchard seized on the suggestion.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. Care to come down to the
Pool, Miss Cressage? It’s sure to be cooler there,
beside the water.”</p>

<p>The girl assented listlessly. Her mind was still
busy with the disaster of the evening. What a fool
she had been! But calling herself names would
hardly help now. She would have to find some way
out of the affair; and the raising of £200 was beyond
her resources completely. Perhaps Mrs. Caistor
Scorton wasn’t so bad as she seemed. Possibly she
might turn out to be rather a decent person; these
surface-hard people often were like that. Of course
the money would have to be found eventually; but
if time were given, something might be done.</p>

<p>The group moved out on to the terrace in front of
the house. Freddie Stickney attached himself to
Nina Lindale, and they went off together down into
the gardens. Eric Dangerfield, looking worried,
approached his uncle, and they followed the other two.
Morchard and Eileen descended the steps and turned
off into one of the side-alleys. Mrs. Brent turned
to the remaining two:</p>

<p>“Mr. Morchard’s quite right, I think,” she said.
“If there’s any coolness to be had to-night, it will
be down at the Pool. Shall we go?”</p>

<p>She looked up at the inky sky with some distrust.
Mrs. Caistor Scorton turned back towards the door.</p>

<p>“It looks very like a downpour,” she reflected.
“I don’t think I’ll join you. I have to write a note
to my bankers and one or two other things, and I
may as well do that now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Mrs. Brent, placidly.
“Perhaps you’re right. Will you risk it, Mrs. Tuxford?”</p>

<p>They moved off in the track of the two
Dangerfields, leaving Mrs. Scorton to return to the house.</p>

<p>“I think we might walk a shade faster,” Mrs.
Brent suggested in a moment or two. She seemed
anxious about something. “I hate moving about at
all on a night like this; but I’d really give a good
deal for a breath of fresh air. It’s like an oven up
there at the house; but down beside the water it
ought to be cooler. Really, if this spell doesn’t
break soon I shall simply take French leave and go
off in the <i>Kestrel</i>.”</p>

<p>She pointed towards the bay, where one or two of
the yacht’s lights flickered upon the water. Mrs.
Tuxford nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>“I know how you feel—nerves all ragged. And
you’ve got a headache, too. Don’t bother to talk.
Let’s walk along quietly and see if the air about the
Pool will do you any good.”</p>

<p>By winding paths they came at last to the edge
of the belt of trees which encircled the sheet of
water. Just before they emerged from the shadows,
Mrs. Brent pulled up and glanced round the Pool.
On the further bank, some forty yards off, she
caught a glimpse of Eileen Cressage’s dress lit up by
the moonlight, and a flash of Morchard’s shirt-front
as he turned a little.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll stop,” said Mrs. Brent to her
companion. “It’s cool enough here under the trees.”</p>

<p>She fell into a listening attitude:</p>

<p>“Did you hear that bird-call?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tuxford strained her ears, but heard nothing.
Mrs. Brent excused herself with a gesture:</p>

<p>“I always forget that my hearing is sharp. Can’t
you even hear those people talking over there?
Sound carries far across water.”</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Tuxford listened intently.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a murmur,” she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent held up a finger.</p>

<p>“There! That bird-call . . . lovely. Do you
mind if I listen to it?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tuxford nodded acquiescence and watched
her companion listening intently to something which
she herself could not catch. Her eyes wandered to
the two figures across the Pool; but they were
standing half in the shadows and she could make very
little of them.</p>

<p>Just at that moment, as it happened, Morchard
was engaged upon a psychological problem very
much after his own heart. He had played bridge
that evening with a steadily growing
satisfaction. To him, Eileen Cressage’s face had been
an open book; and he had read without
difficulty the thoughts which passed through her mind.</p>

<p>“That girl’s in difficulties,” he had ruminated, as
the game progressed. “I know the signs. She’ll
not be able to pay. I know the Scorton; she’ll want
her money. Little Cressage hasn’t a blue cent. I
like these dark-haired, pale-skinned girls, especially
when they’re rather shy, like her.”</p>

<p>The incident of the cheque had been clear as
glass.</p>

<p>“The Scorton won’t collect much on that, or I’m
mistaken. It’ll come back with ‘Refer to Drawer’
on it, sure enough. And the girl knows it, too.
She’s just staved off trouble for a few hours. That
is, unless someone else foots the bill. Two
hundred’s only a flea-bite.”</p>

<p>He had wandered down to the Pool beside Eileen
without saying very much. That would give her
time to think over things and to realise what a hole
she had got herself into. Card-debts were things
one simply had to pay. At one point only he had
broken the silence, and then it was to relate an
anecdote of Mrs. Caistor Scorton, an anecdote which
brought out to the full the hardness of that lady’s
character where money was concerned. When they
reached the shore, he glanced round to see that no
one was within ear-shot. The figures of Mrs. Brent
and her companion, hidden in the belt of trees,
escaped his eye.</p>

<p>“Sorry you had bad luck to-night, Miss Cressage.
Cards were rather against you people.”</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage’s voice was not quite under
control. She tried to steady it and speak lightly.</p>

<p>“I suppose one must expect that, now and again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Your turn last night; ours to-night.
Yours again to-morrow night, very likely. We’ll
give you a chance for your revenge then.”</p>

<p>Eileen thought of her worthless cheque and
shivered a little. No matter how things went, there
would be no bridge for her next night.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall play to-morrow,” she said,
hesitatingly. “I’m rather tired of bridge.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Sorry to hear that. Quite looked forward
to it.”</p>

<p>“No; I shan’t play any more.” She found her
lip quivering and stiffened it with an effort.
Morchard had caught the movement in her moon-lit face.
“Shall we go back to the house?”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, Miss Cressage, I’ve something
to say.”</p>

<p>She turned back towards him and he studied her
features for a moment; then he continued, as though
he had just made a discovery:</p>

<p>“Now I guess what’s wrong. I knew something
was up. You’re hard up? Isn’t that it?”</p>

<p>Eileen’s face was sufficient answer. Morchard’s
voice became sympathetic.</p>

<p>“Really hard up? That’s beastly.”</p>

<p>Then, watching her keenly, he appeared to make
a fresh discovery:</p>

<p>“That cheque you handed over to-night, no good,
eh? Overdrawn your account? Well, well.”</p>

<p>He drew closer to the girl.</p>

<p>“Look here, Eileen, this is an awkward affair.
You’ve got yourself into a bad hole. I know the
Scorton. She’ll send that cheque off to-night to her
bank—no, first thing to-morrow morning. I could
see it in her eye. She suspects it’s a dud. And by
to-morrow night she’ll know it hasn’t been met.
And then she’ll make a row. She’ll make the devil
of a row. I know her.”</p>

<p>He paused, letting this sink in.</p>

<p>“You’ll need to get out of it somehow.”</p>

<p>The girl’s defences were down completely. This
brute, with his mottled face and close-set eyes, had
seen the whole affair. If he knew, everybody else
might know also. He had told her nothing she had
not guessed for herself; but the mere putting of it
into definite words made it seem a worse business
than ever. She made an unconscious gesture, as
though trying to ward off the catastrophe.
Morchard grew more sympathetic.</p>

<p>“Now, listen, Eileen. There’s an easy way out.
Two hundred’s nothing to me; I can easily spare it.
I’ll lend it to you. You can pay it back any time
you like; I shan’t miss it. That’s all right now. All
your worries over! Come to my room to-night and
I’ll give you a cheque. You can go up to town
to-morrow, first thing, and pay it into your bank in
time to meet that cheque you gave the Scorton.”</p>

<p>Before the girl could reply Mrs. Brent’s voice
sounded across the water:</p>

<p>“Miss Cressage!”</p>

<p>Eileen started at the call; and, turning, she saw
Mrs. Brent and Mrs. Tuxford coming from among
the trees.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, they’re too far off to have heard
what we were saying,” she reflected, measuring the
distance with her eye.</p>

<p>Then she called in reply; and she was further
relieved to find it difficult to make them hear what
she said.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a glow-worm?” Mrs.
Brent’s voice came faintly over the Pool. “Come
round and look at this one I’ve found.”</p>

<p>Eileen turned away from Morchard and made her
way round the water’s edge to where the two women
were standing. Morchard followed her sullenly, his
anger at the interruption being evident, though he
was doing his best to conceal it.</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Brent led them back into the
spinney and tried to point out the glow-worm, it
had vanished.</p>

<p>“That’s a pity,” she said, glancing side-long at
Morchard as she spoke. “I really thought I had it
and could pick it up again easily enough.”</p>

<p>She poked about for a moment or two among the
grass at the edge of the little wood.</p>

<p>“No, I’m afraid it’s escaped. Creatures do get
away, unless one keeps an eye on them. And it was
such a pretty little thing, too.”</p>

<p>This time her face was in the moonlight, and there
was no mistaking the mockery in her expression as
she turned to Morchard.</p>

<p>“Well, my headache’s a little better. Shall we go
back to the house? These wood-paths won’t let us
walk four abreast, I’m afraid. Mr. Morchard, you
and Mrs. Tuxford had better go first.”</p>

<p>She stood aside to let them pass. Then, before
following them, she whispered a few words to
Eileen. The girl nodded and they went up the
path in the track of Morchard and his companion.
As they came into the gardens, Mrs. Brent noticed
Wraxall and old Dangerfield in one of the alleys.
The American was talking earnestly, while his host
listened to him with his usual polite aloofness.
Again Mrs. Brent’s face betrayed a flash of mockery;
but she made no remark to the girl at her side, and
together they passed on towards the house.</p>

<p>She had been quite correct in her reading of the
situation. Wraxall, despite her friendly warning,
had made up his mind to approach their host with a
direct offer for the Dangerfield Talisman. He had
shown considerable tact in his manner of introducing
the subject, for Mrs. Brent’s hints had not been lost
upon him. But, just as she had predicted, he met
with an uncompromising refusal.</p>

<p>“Part with our Talisman, Mr. Wraxall? It’s out
of the question!”</p>

<p>The American tried to work round the flank of
the defence.</p>

<p>“One moment, Mr. Dangerfield, before you make
up your mind definitely. Perhaps I could say
something to alter your views. I’m a collector. I’m not
the keeper of a public museum. I want your
Talisman for its own sake. I want it for itself and for
myself. I shouldn’t put it in a show-case with a
ticket on it. No one would know that you had
transferred it. The matter would be entirely
between ourselves—completely private.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield halted for a moment in his
stride.</p>

<p>“And how would you propose to account for its
disappearance from Friocksheim, then? Anyone
looking at our empty cabinet would know that it
had gone.”</p>

<p>Wraxall had his solution ready.</p>

<p>“A replica, of course. That could be made in a
few days, by these modern electro-plating methods;
and paste stones could be put in, instead of the real
ones. It would serve well enough. It wouldn’t be
spotted, Mr. Dangerfield, if you kept it out of
people’s hands. You’d never talk; I wouldn’t talk;
no one would ever know.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield turned in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“That’s a very ingenious idea, Mr. Wraxall. But
the Talisman is not for sale.”</p>

<p>The American apparently had not quite given up
his project.</p>

<p>“Well, think it over,” he begged. “No one would
ever know. It would only be a case of borrowing
the Talisman for a day or two, to get the replica
made. Then you put the replica into the cabinet;
I get the Talisman, and nobody’s any the wiser.
Think it over again.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield seemed deep in thought. He
made no reply, and they walked on once more.
On the horizon a faint flicker of sheet-lightning
illumined the sky, heralding the coming storm. As
they turned back towards Friocksheim, the moon
slipped behind the edge of the thunder-cloud.</p>

<h2>Chapter IV</h2>

<p>Douglas Fairmile, coming down to breakfast next
morning, found Nina and Cynthia already at table.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Douglas,” Cynthia greeted him.
“You don’t seem quite your usual bright self to-day.
A trifle heavy-eyed and even duller-looking than
usual. Did the thunder keep you awake?”</p>

<p>“Rather! My sensitive temperament, you know.
High strung and all that. The least thing puts me
off my sleep.”</p>

<p>Cynthia looked him over with mock sympathy.</p>

<p>“Ah! Neurasthenic, no doubt. It’s hard lines on
these healthy looking people, Nina; their nerves are
all fiddlestrings really, but they get no sympathy
because they look so frightfully robust. Observe,
however, the leaden eye, the trembling hand. He’ll
be biting a bit out of his tea-cup if we don’t manage
to soothe him.”</p>

<p>“I’d just love to have you for a nurse if I went
sick,” Douglas affirmed. “And the toast, please,
since you happen to be so handy to it. Thanks.
I suppose the storm passed quite unnoticed at your
end of the house?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” Nina said, nervously. “It gave me
the fright of my life. I had to creep away to
Cynthia’s room for comfort. I hate thunder,
especially when it comes near.”</p>

<p>“It was near enough last night. One of the trees
in the garden was struck. You can see it from the
door.”</p>

<p>“That must have been the peal that drove me
out of my wits, then. I knew it was close at
hand.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s cleared the air, that’s one good thing,”
said Douglas, glancing through the window at the
big white clouds sailing in the blue. “All the
stuffiness has gone now. This is going to be a day for
careful enjoyment, too good to waste on mere
reckless frivolity.”</p>

<p>He looked sternly at Cynthia.</p>

<p>“I do love Friocksheim,” said Nina, irrelevantly.
“It’s a place where one can do just as one likes and
no one bothers about things.”</p>

<p>“What about borrowing the <i>Kestrel</i> and going
up the coast until the afternoon?” suggested
Cynthia. “Mrs. Brent would let us have it if we
asked her.”</p>

<p>Douglas glanced again through the window.</p>

<p>“Hullo! She’s gone!”</p>

<p>“What a nuisance!” Cynthia looked over the
empty waters of the bay. “Mrs. Brent said
something last night about going off in the yacht, but I
didn’t think she meant it. She’s evidently taken
the <i>Kestrel</i> herself, though. That notion’s knocked
on the head.”</p>

<p>The door opened to admit Freddie Stickney.
Even as he came in, they could see that he was
preparing a sensation for them. His prying little
eyes ran over the group, estimating the character
of his audience.</p>

<p>“Heard the latest?” he demanded, importantly.</p>

<p>“Spare us the usual preliminaries, Freddie,”
Douglas implored. “Don’t drag out the agony.
Flop right in at the deep end. If it’s an
earthquake in Frogsholme or any other little thing like
that, why just give us the simple tale in the fewest
words.”</p>

<p>Freddie Stickney seemed to feel that his sensation
was big enough to let him follow Douglas’s advice.
He came to the point without more ado.</p>

<p>“The Talisman’s been stolen,” he announced, with
a certain undercurrent of malicious enjoyment in
his voice. “That’s a nasty knock for the
Dangerfields.”</p>

<p>For a moment his three hearers failed to take in
his news.</p>

<p>“The Talisman?” exclaimed Nina. “You don’t
mean to say somebody’s taken it?”</p>

<p>Freddie confirmed his statement with a smile.</p>

<p>“Are you sure about this, Freddie, or is it just
some rot you’re making up?” demanded Douglas.</p>

<p>“Quite sure about it. I’ve been to look at the
cabinet where it’s kept, to make certain; and it’s
gone. No sign of it.”</p>

<p>Cynthia looked distressed.</p>

<p>“That’s bad business, isn’t it? Poor Mr.
Dangerfield! The Talisman’s the thing he values most
in the world, I should think. He’ll be fearfully
cut up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll be all that,” agreed Freddie,
unsympathetically. “But it’s a beastly nuisance.
Friocksheim will be swarming with police and
detectives—probably unofficial ’tecs as well. The Dangerfields
will do anything to get the thing back again, you can
bet. It’ll be most unpleasant for all of us. They’ll
expect us to turn out our suit-cases to see that none
of us has taken it.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the harm in that?” inquired
Cynthia. “They can do what they like, so far as I’m
concerned. The main thing is to get the thing back
again. I suppose they’ll get it back in a day or
two?”</p>

<p>Douglas looked doubtful.</p>

<p>“Depends who’s taken it, Cynthia. There’s no
saying. But perhaps it hasn’t been stolen at all,”
he ended, hopefully. “It may just have been taken
away to be cleaned or something like that.”</p>

<p>“Wrong, there,” said Freddie, with a self-satisfied
air. “It’s been stolen. I managed to worm that
out of the butler.”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you?” Douglas’s expression showed
what he thought of Freddie’s methods.</p>

<p>“Yes. At least, I got enough from him to put
two and two together. There’s been a theft of some
sort, whether it was burglary or stealing from
inside the house.”</p>

<p>“What a horrible business!” Nina was evidently
upset by the affair. “It’ll be a terrible shock for the
Dangerfields, won’t it? I do hope they get it back
again almost at once. I wish it hadn’t happened.
I do wish it hadn’t happened!”</p>

<p>Freddie stared at her in a patronising way.</p>

<p>“I should worry over it. It’s really the
Dangerfields’ own fault for taking no precautions. Fancy
leaving the thing standing about in that open cabinet,
ready for anyone to lift! One can’t have much
sympathy with them, after all.”</p>

<p>“I think I can spare a little,” Cynthia commented,
icily.</p>

<p>Freddie had a further tit-bit which he had held in
reserve.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so,” he said. “Why, they never
took the trouble to insure the thing. That’s
inexcusable carelessness. Really, they seem to
deserve all they’ve got.”</p>

<p>Douglas leaned forward in surprise.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say, Freddie, that the thing
wasn’t insured?”</p>

<p>“So I believe,” asserted Freddie. “I got it out of
the butler before he realised what he was saying.”</p>

<p>Douglas passed this explanation without comment.</p>

<p>“Why, the thing’s impossible! The stones in the
Talisman are worth more than £50,000. Nobody
would dream of keeping a thing like that uninsured!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll find I’m right,” said Freddie,
weightily. “And that’s why we shall be flooded out with
police and detectives. Obviously they’ve simply
got to get it back. Nobody cares to lose £50,000.”</p>

<p>Nina was plainly taken aback by the figure.</p>

<p>“I should think not. I’d no idea it was worth so
much. What a loss for poor Mr. Dangerfield.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll have to stand it, if the thing isn’t
recovered,” said Freddie, philosophically.</p>

<p>“It makes me frightfully nervous,” admitted Nina.
“Just think, Cynthia, that burglar may have been
prowling about near us in the night. It gives me the
creeps!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all over now,” Cynthia soothed her.
“You’re too nervous, Nina. If it has been a burglar,
he’s not in the least likely to come back again.
You can sleep quite quietly so far as that goes.”</p>

<p>Freddie hastened to play the part of consoler.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need worry. There’s nothing
much else in the house. The Dangerfields haven’t
a big stock of jewellery. The Talisman was about
the only thing worth taking in the whole place.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m ever so sorry about it,” Nina
reaffirmed. “It makes everything different to-day.
Friocksheim won’t be the same, with this hanging
over it. How could one enjoy oneself when this
has happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh, one does what one can,” Freddie reassured
her. “Worrying won’t help.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Freddie,” commented Douglas,
contemptuously. “Have your principles, and act
according! The stern, unbending Roman touch, eh?”</p>

<p>“Where’s Mrs. Caistor Scorton?” inquired Freddie.</p>

<p>He was evidently anxious to find a fresh auditor
for this news.</p>

<p>“She was just finishing her breakfast when I
came down,” volunteered Nina. “I think she’s gone
out.”</p>

<p>Freddie was plainly disappointed by this
information.</p>

<p>“She must have been down a good deal earlier
than usual,” he grumbled. “Where’s Wraxall?”</p>

<p>“Not down yet,” said Douglas. “I expect the
storm kept him awake like the rest of us, and he’s
been putting in some extra sleep. He’ll be down
later on.”</p>

<p>He glanced at the two girls, and all three rose.</p>

<p>“Well, ta-ta, Freddie. We’re leaving you in the
best of company, so you’ll excuse us if we go.”</p>

<p>Freddie’s expression showed that he saw the irony
without appreciating it.</p>

<p>“See you later,” he snapped, going on with his
breakfast as the others filed out of the room.</p>

<p>On that day Wraxall awoke later than usual and
dressed with a certain leisureliness. He had been
about during the small hours of the morning; and
even after he went to bed, some time had elapsed
before he managed to fall asleep. On reaching the
breakfast-room at last, he was not altogether pleased
to find Freddie Stickney the only other occupant.</p>

<p>“Thunder keep you awake too?” demanded
Freddie, as Wraxall took his seat. “Cleared the air,
anyway. That’s one blessing.”</p>

<p>“I sat up and watched the storm,” said the
American, shortly.</p>

<p>“Frightful racket, wasn’t it?” Freddie inquired.</p>

<p>Wraxall nodded vaguely and attacked his
breakfast.</p>

<p>“Heard the great news?” persisted Freddie, not
to be baulked.</p>

<p>Wraxall, who preferred to breakfast peacefully,
looked across the table with an expression of the
very faintest interest.</p>

<p>“News?” he asked. “No. I haven’t seen a
paper yet. My doctor tells me it’s better to read
later on. He advises me to concentrate at
breakfast-time. I share his views. I believe he’s right.”</p>

<p>Freddie ignored the hint.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s not in the papers. It’s a Friocksheim
tit-bit, exclusive. The Dangerfield Talisman’s been
stolen!”</p>

<p>If he expected to read anything in the American’s
face, he was disappointed. Wraxall’s lean
countenance betrayed no emotion of any sort, not even
surprise. He continued to masticate stolidly for a
few moments, as though excluding all extraneous
ideas. Freddie felt that a good item of news had
been wasted.</p>

<p>“How do you know it’s been stolen?” inquired
Wraxall, at length.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s gone, at any rate.”</p>

<p>Wraxall glanced across the table.</p>

<p>“That’s hardly the same thing, Mr. Stickney. If
I drop a dollar in the street without noticing it,
the dollar’s gone; but it isn’t necessarily stolen.
When I send a clock to be cleaned, it’s gone too;
but the clock-maker isn’t a thief for all that. Let’s
be accurate, if <em>you</em> please.”</p>

<p>This was hardly the reception Freddie had
anticipated.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s gone, at any rate,” he repeated. “And
if it’s gone, somebody must have taken it. It didn’t
walk off by itself. And if anybody took it, that’s
theft, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Wraxall appeared to consider this proposition with
some care before replying.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied, after a pause. “No, I’d hardly
care to go so far as that. Hardly. Mr. Rollo
Dangerfield may have taken it—that wouldn’t be
theft, since it belongs to him. Somebody may have
borrowed it—borrowing isn’t theft. No, it seems
to me you’re rather apt to jump to conclusions, Mr.
Stickney. I can’t follow you to that length.”</p>

<p>Freddie Stickney flushed slightly. This
confounded Yank was evidently presuming to pull his
leg. Freddie contented himself with a reiteration
of his former remark:</p>

<p>“Well, it’s gone, at any rate.”</p>

<p>As he said it, his eyes swept the American’s face,
and for an instant he seemed to catch a glimpse of
something going on behind the mask. Wraxall was
evidently perturbed and his eyes showed that he
was thinking hard, though his face gave no clue
to the subject which occupied him.</p>

<p>Freddie relapsed for a time into sulky silence,
and Wraxall was able to continue his meal
undisturbed. From time to time, Freddie’s beady eyes
ranged round to the American’s face; but its set
expression betrayed nothing to him. Freddie began
to contrast the reception which Wraxall had given
to his news with the outburst of sympathy for the
Dangerfields which had come from Douglas and the
girls.</p>

<p>“Something very fishy about this fellow,” he
thought to himself. “One would almost think it
wasn’t news to him at all. And why is he so
anxious to make out that it isn’t a case of theft?
That’s very rum.”</p>

<p>Freddie chewed the cud of this idea for a minute
or two; but at last, feeling the lack of conversation
to be too great a strain, he tried another opening.</p>

<p>“Very few at breakfast to-day.”</p>

<p>The American glanced round the empty table, but
made no audible comment.</p>

<p>“Three of the party went off first thing this
morning,” Freddie continued. “Mrs. Brent’s away in
the <i>Kestrel</i>. Didn’t wait to say good-bye to me.”</p>

<p>At last a gleam of interest crossed the American’s
face.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brent’s gone? Now, I’m sorry to hear
that, Mr. Stickney. I shall miss her. She’s a most
understanding person. I’m sorry. But perhaps
she’s only gone for the day?”</p>

<p>Freddie Stickney had to admit ignorance.</p>

<p>“She didn’t leave any message about when she’d
be back. And Eileen Cressage went off by the first
train. But she’ll be back to-night, most likely. So
will young Dangerfield. He’s gone, too.”</p>

<p>Wraxall nodded, but said nothing. Freddie was
emboldened to proceed.</p>

<p>“Funny—their going just when the Talisman’s
disappeared—isn’t it? The Dangerfield Luck gone,
and all of them clear out at once. Like rats leaving
a sinking ship, what? It seems rum, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>The American’s brief spell of interest in Freddie’s
conversation came abruptly to an end. This time
there was no doubt about it. Freddie’s latest news
item must have started a fresh train of thought in
Wraxall’s mind, and he was devoting his whole
attention to following it out. Freddie attempted to
break in once or twice, but received no
encouragement beyond absent-minded nods which might have
meant anything; so at last he rose and left the
room.</p>

<h2>Chapter V</h2>

<p>After Freddie Stickney had closed the door behind
him, Wraxall frankly abandoned any pretence of
being interested in his food. He pushed back his
chair slightly and seemed to concentrate his whole
mind for a time upon some intricate problem.</p>

<p>“I’d better see the old man as soon as I can,”
he said, half aloud, at one point in his train of
thought. “The first thing to do is to see how the
land lies. It’s a tight position.”</p>

<p>But a final solution of his problem evidently
evaded him; and when he got up and went in search
of his host, it was clear that he still remained in
doubt about something.</p>

<p>“I’ll get it over, at least,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>In spite of his age, Rollo Dangerfield was an early
riser, compared with some of his guests. He had
breakfasted an hour before, and Wraxall found him
in the morning-room, engrossed in a newspaper. As
his guest came in, Rollo put the sheet aside and
looked up.</p>

<p>“Terrible storm last night, Mr. Wraxall. I hope
it didn’t keep you awake through half the night.”</p>

<p>“I like storms,” the American assured him. “I
sat up a good part of the night to watch that one.
It would have been a pity to miss it. I enjoyed
it—immensely. The effects were very fine at times,
Mr. Dangerfield, very fine indeed. A magnificent
spectacle.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield seemed relieved that his guest
had suffered no inconvenience.</p>

<p>“I wish everybody could say the same,” he said.
“Poor Mrs. Brent didn’t share your enthusiasm, I’m
afraid. She’s peculiarly sensitive to electrical
conditions—always has been so. Her nerves seem to
go all to pieces in a storm, and I think that one
last night affected her badly. She went off in the
<i>Kestrel</i> this morning before any of us were up, and
I expect she’ll stay away until she gets back to
normal again.”</p>

<p>The American paused a moment or two before
replying.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear that. She didn’t strike me as
a nervous type. I should have said she was very
well balanced, if you’d asked my opinion.”</p>

<p>“Each of us has his own special weakness,” said
the old man, phlegmatically. “Some people can’t
stand cats, for some reason. I dislike house-spiders
intensely myself, though I can’t give you any
grounds for my aversion. In Mrs. Brent’s case, it
seems to be thunder and lightning. A storm shakes
her completely.”</p>

<p>Wraxall let the subject drop. Old Dangerfield
puzzled him at this moment. Of course the English
had the knack of concealing their feelings; but he
had expected something different in Rollo this
morning, if the story about the Talisman were true. He
resolved on a direct attack.</p>

<p>“I met young Stickney at breakfast. He said
something about the Talisman.”</p>

<p>Old Dangerfield let his newspaper slip from his
hand as though he were tired of holding it.</p>

<p>“Freddie? Oh, Freddie can be trusted to know
all about everything. He’s often right, too, quite
often. Yes, the Talisman’s gone.”</p>

<p>The old man’s voice was completely indifferent;
he might have been discussing some matter of no
especial concern, for all the interest that showed in
his tone. The American was taken aback. These
English, he reflected, don’t give much away. Here
was a man who had lost overnight the thing that
he evidently valued as the first among his
possessions; and yet he showed less emotion than he might
have done if a cat had gone astray. Wraxall’s
opinion of Rollo Dangerfield went up considerably.
There was a dignity behind this indifference which
impressed him deeply. No fuss, no excitement to
be seen. The thing was gone; but the old man
could hold himself in. His guests wouldn’t be
disturbed by him. Everything would go on as usual
at Friocksheim. Rollo Dangerfield evidently carried
the courtesy of a host to the extreme.</p>

<p>“That’s a big loss,” said Wraxall, slowly. “But
I expect you’re counting on getting it back. It
would be difficult to dispose of. It would certainly
be hard to sell. Still . . . aren’t you sorry you
didn’t close with my offer last night?”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield turned an inscrutable face to
his guest.</p>

<p>“Sorry I didn’t sell the Talisman while I had
it? No, it never was for sale. The matter didn’t
arise.”</p>

<p>The American persisted.</p>

<p>“I suppose the police have some clue?”</p>

<p>The old man shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>“The police have nothing to do with it. How
could they have a clue?”</p>

<p>Wraxall was frankly astonished.</p>

<p>“You haven’t called them in? Why, I should
have thought the very first thing to do would be
to get them to work while the scent was fresh?”</p>

<p>A faint shade of irritation showed in Rollo
Dangerfield’s eyes, the first sign of emotion the American
had seen. But when he spoke, his voice was as
indifferent as before.</p>

<p>“Why should we call in the police? The Talisman
will find its way home without their help. Would
you bring the police among your guests, stir up
trouble, make everyone uncomfortable with
suspicions and cross-questioning? No, Mr. Wraxall,
we shan’t need the police at Friocksheim. I told
you so, before the Talisman disappeared, and you
obviously didn’t believe me. But you see now that
you were mistaken; I meant what I said.”</p>

<p>The American was shrewd enough to see what
had given offence. Old Dangerfield resented the
slight on his veracity much more than the loss of
the Talisman. He made amends frankly.</p>

<p>“Quite right, Mr. Dangerfield. Honestly, I
thought you were just leading us on, that night.
I took it that you were pulling my leg. It seemed
to me that perhaps it was one of your English jokes,
just put out to see if the stranger would swallow
it. We often do that ourselves, over there. But
I see you mean it, right enough, now.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield reassured him with a faint smile.</p>

<p>“I see your point of view. I ought to have thought
of it in that light.”</p>

<p>Wraxall considered for a moment or two before
speaking again.</p>

<p>“I think I see what’s in your mind,” he said, going
back to the earlier subject. “You’ve reason to
suspect somebody in particular—one of the maids,
perhaps—and you don’t want a fuss?”</p>

<p>“I don’t suspect any of the maids—or any of the
servants,” Rollo Dangerfield replied instantly.
“That’s quite out of the question. I can tell you
why. We have a number of old habits at
Friocksheim, and fortunately one of them has enabled
us to clear our servants of any suspicion in this
affair.”</p>

<p>He took out his case and lit a cigar before
continuing.</p>

<p>“The servants’ quarters are all in the west wing
of the house, and there is only one door
communicating between their section and the other part of
the building. That door has a special lock, of which
only the butler has a key, and it is his duty at
half-past eleven every night to see that that door
is secured. After that, no servant can get into this
part of the house without his knowledge.”</p>

<p>“And the butler himself?” demanded the
American.</p>

<p>“The butler’s great-grandfather was born on the
estate and for four generations we have known
absolutely everything about the family. This man
has been in our service since he was a boy, and a
more absolutely honest man you couldn’t find
anywhere. You may put him completely out of your
calculations, Mr. Wraxall. I say that definitely,
because the man can’t speak for himself. Not a
trace of suspicion could attach to him. Now are
you satisfied?”</p>

<p>Wraxall nodded his acquiescence. Then he asked
a further question.</p>

<p>“How did you hear that the Talisman had gone?”</p>

<p>“The butler told me this morning. His first
business is to go round the house after he has
unlocked the communicating door. When he went
into the Corinthian’s Room he noticed that the
Talisman case was open, and the jewel was gone.
He came at once and told me.”</p>

<p>“And you suspect nobody, then?”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield raised himself slightly in his
chair and looked round directly at Wraxall’s face.
For the first time, the American saw a keenness in
the old man’s blue eyes, though their expression
was inscrutable.</p>

<p>“No, I suspect nobody. I have no evidence, and
I do not wish to collect any. The Talisman will be
back in its place within a week; and that is the only
important thing in the case. For all I know, the
whole affair may be a practical joke. Some of these
young folks may have taken it into their heads to
test the Dangerfield legend.”</p>

<p>His eyes scanned the American’s features; but
Wraxall betrayed nothing under the scrutiny.
Rollo Dangerfield pulled at his cigar before
continuing.</p>

<p>“I can imagine one of these youngsters playing
a practical joke like that. Take away the Talisman
and see what old Dangerfield will say! It’s quite
possible that somebody”—he glanced again at the
American—“may even now be wishing he had left
the thing alone and may be looking for a chance
to replace it under the bell. It’s an awkward thing
to have in one’s possession—even innocently. Well,
they can easily put it back again, if they wish to
do so. Nobody’s watching the Corinthian’s Room.”</p>

<p>A faintly sardonic expression crossed his face.</p>

<p>“Don’t distress yourself unduly about the
Talisman, Mr. Wraxall. It will come home quite safely
in the end; you may take my word for that.”</p>

<p>With a gesture as though asking permission, he
picked up his newspaper again. Wraxall accepted
the tacit dismissal and wandered out into the sunlit
gardens. The interview had given him a good deal
to think about, apparently. He avoided the other
guests and spent a considerable time in going over
old Dangerfield’s words, so far as he could remember
them.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said to himself at last. “I
wonder if the old man suspects anything. One or two
of these remarks might have been directed to my
address, though he was clever enough to give them
an inoffensive turn. If he really suspects me, it
looks like being a pretty kettle of fish. It certainly
looks like that.”</p>

<p>He thought it tactful to absent himself for the
rest of the day, taking his car and visiting some of
the local antiquities which he wished to see. It
was dinner-time before he met his fellow-guests once
more.</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage had returned, and Westenhanger
came into the room immediately after her. As they
sat down, Freddie Stickney’s eyes travelled round
the table, obviously counting the number, and a
certain disappointment appeared in his face when
he found only twelve persons present. Eric
Dangerfield and Mrs. Brent were still away.</p>

<p>“You and Mr. Westenhanger came up by the
same train, didn’t you, Miss Cressage?” asked Mrs.
Dangerfield.</p>

<p>Westenhanger caught the question which Eileen
had missed.</p>

<p>“Yes. I happened to run across Miss Cressage
just as she was coming out of Starbeck, the jewellers.
We had just time to get to the station.”</p>

<p>Freddie Stickney’s sharp ears caught the careless
remark.</p>

<p>“Starbeck’s?” he said, lifting his voice to make
it carry down the table. “That’s a convenient firm.
They’ll give you a reasonable advance on any little
bit of jewellery you don’t happen to need for a
time. Sort of superior brand of West End Uncle,
aren’t they? I’ve dealt with them once or twice
myself and always found them generous.”</p>

<p>Freddie was quite shameless in money matters.
But his deliberately pitched sentences reached Eileen
Cressage’s ears; and Freddie, keenly on the
look-out, noticed that the girl flushed uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“That shot went home,” he reflected, complacently.
“One can always get the information one wants if
one goes about it tactfully. She’s been doing a bit
of quiet pawning this afternoon. That’s
interesting. I wonder what she put away in store. She
never wore any jewellery here.”</p>

<p>He ruminated on this problem for a time, keeping
his sharp eyes on the girl’s face; but nothing further
of interest fell into his net during the meal.</p>

<p>As they passed into the drawing-room after
dinner, Mrs. Caistor Scorton picked up a telegram
addressed to her which was lying in the hall. At
the sight of it, Morchard’s face lighted up with
interest and he examined her closely while she read
it. He edged himself up to Eileen and put a
question in a low voice:</p>

<p>“The Scorton’s got her telegram about your
cheque. Is it all right?”</p>

<p>“Quite all right, thank you,” said the girl, coldly.</p>

<p>She moved away from him immediately, and as
she sat down, Conway Westenhanger came up.</p>

<p>“Have a game at bridge, Miss Cressage? They’re
making up a table and I’ve reserved a place for
you.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I’d rather not play.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton passed close to them and
Eileen made a gesture to catch her attention.</p>

<p>“You found my cheque all right, Mrs. Scorton?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger, to his surprise, detected more than
a tinge of irony in the question. Mrs. Caistor
Scorton seemed taken aback for a moment; but she
recovered herself almost at once:</p>

<p>“Oh, quite all right, quite all right,” she
confirmed shortly, and passed on to the bridge-table.</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage knitted her brows slightly as she
looked after her. At any rate, she had got out of
that difficulty. Morchard had been quite right.
The woman had obviously sent the cheque off to
her bank and asked them to wire if it had been
met. That apparently inevitable scandal had passed
over safely. She glanced across at Morchard and
an angrier flash came into her eyes. She knew what
sort of a person he was, too.</p>

<p>Freddie Stickney drifted over and sat down
between her and Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“Heard the news, you two? The Talisman’s out
of print, it seems. No copies available for the
public. Somebody’s taken a fancy to it and simply
lifted it. That’s a fine end to all the Dangerfield
talk, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>With a certain ill-suppressed maliciousness, he
gave them all the information he had collected
during the day.</p>

<p>“Just as well you were away last night,
Westenhanger,” he wound up. “You’re clear of suspicion.
But all the rest of us are in it up to the neck.
Servants exonerated without a stain on their
character. Strong suspicion attaches to every guest.
That’s how the land lies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed, Freddie,” said Westenhanger.
“Then, if we must suspect somebody, we may as
well begin with yourself. What about it?
Anything you say will be used against you at the trial,
without regard for age or sex. Where’s my
notebook?”</p>

<p>“It’s all very well for you,” protested Freddie.
“You’re out of it all. But what about the rest of
us? It’s a nasty idea to feel that the person sitting
next to you in this room may be a thief.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger looked him up and down for a
moment before replying.</p>

<p>“If I were you, Freddie, I don’t think I’d begin
flinging words like ‘thief’ about quite so early in the
day. These things are apt to be resented by some
people. Isn’t there any other possible explanation?”</p>

<p>Freddie pondered for a while in silence, then he
made a half-hearted suggestion:</p>

<p>“It might be a practical joke.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger considered the idea and rejected it
almost immediately.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t like to have the taste of the man
who played a joke of that sort. Who’s your
humorist? Douglas is the funny man of the company, but
Douglas wouldn’t play a trick of that sort on
anyone. That’s certain. Morchard hasn’t that kind of
mind. The American has a sense of humour, but not
that sort, I’m sure. You don’t attribute it to one
of the girls, do you? No? Well, then, that leaves
us with . . . let’s see . . . with Mr. Frederick
Stickney as the only possible culprit. I don’t think
much of your taste in humour, Freddie, and that’s a
fact.”</p>

<p>“All the same,” said Eileen Cressage, “I’d prefer
it to be a case of practical joking rather than the
other thing. Perhaps it will all come right and we
shall find the Talisman back again in a few days,
just as Mr. Dangerfield said.”</p>

<p>Freddie had recovered from Westenhanger’s
attack.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to find out who did it,” he
declared. “As things stand, we’re all under a cloud.
I’m going to get the whole lot into the billiard room
later on, if I can, away from the Dangerfields;
and I shall put it to them straight that each person
ought to account for his doings during the night.
Nobody could object to that.”</p>

<p>He glanced at the girl for support and was
surprised to see her flush and turn away as though to
conceal her face.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll be altogether popular if
you start that kind of thing, Mr. Stickney,” she
said.</p>

<p>Freddie’s bright little eyes fastened themselves on
her face; and his well-trained mind automatically set
to work to draw inferences from what he saw. As
his friend had said, Freddie’s inferences always
tended to discredit somebody or something. He had
sense enough, however, to leave his conclusions
unspoken.</p>

<p>“It’s a silly idea, Freddie,” said Westenhanger,
abruptly.</p>

<p>He also had noticed the girl’s flush; but the
only inference he had cared to draw was that Freddie
was making her uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“I can’t agree with you.” Freddie was
emboldened by the girl’s embarrassment. “I think
everyone would be only too glad to exonerate
themselves from suspicion. We oughtn’t to be left under
a cloud if we can clear ourselves straight off.
Decidedly not. I shall insist on it; and I’ll point out
what it will look like if anyone refuses.”</p>

<p>He got up and walked away from them without
waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>Westenhanger looked across at Eileen and was
puzzled by the distress which he still found in her
face.</p>

<p>“That little beast will make trouble unless he gets
his way. Miss Cressage, I think I’ll have to attend
his proposed inquest myself. It seems to be the
occasion where an impartial and disinterested
person might be useful.”</p>

<p>Eileen glanced at his face for a moment. He was
relieved to find that she met his eye squarely and
showed no signs of flinching.</p>

<p>“I think that would be a good plan, Mr.
Westenhanger.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we shall have to go through with
it if he gets his way. And he’s pretty sure to
arrange it, you know. That suggestion that it will
look black if anyone refuses is pretty sure to rake
in most of them, and the rest can’t stand out after
that, even if they wished to.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch06">

<h2>Chapter VI</h2>

<p>“Now,” said Freddie Stickney, “I think we can
begin.”</p>

<p>He had been as good as his word. Each guest
had been approached by him apart from the rest;
and the appropriate hint, insinuation, or appeal, had
been skilfully employed. They had all come,
willingly or not, and Freddie had them at his mercy.
His beady little eyes, bright as those of a mouse,
glanced from face to face in an attempt to read the
expressions. Already, he judged, most of them
were uncomfortable; and the production of
discomfort was Freddie’s strong card. He cleared his
throat gently in preparation for his opening
statement of the case as he saw it; but just at that
moment the door clicked and Westenhanger stepped
into the room.</p>

<p>“Look here, Westenhanger, you can’t come in just
now,” protested Freddie, who augured little good
from the engineer’s presence. “This is a private
affair.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger stared at him with admirably acted
surprise.</p>

<p>“Are you getting up a charade to amuse the
Dangerfield family, or something like that? I don’t
think much of the notion, but I’m quite game to
join if all the rest of you are in it. Go ahead;
don’t let me interrupt.”</p>

<p>He selected a chair near Eileen Cressage and sat
down. Freddie bit his lip in vexation.
Westenhanger’s entrance had taken him aback; he had not
bargained for the presence of anyone except those
who came under suspicion. For a moment he
thought of arguing the point and contesting
Westenhanger’s right to be there at all; but a glance at the
engineer’s face showed him the uselessness of any
such attempt. Quite obviously Westenhanger meant
to sit through the business.</p>

<p>“Get on with it, Freddie,” directed Douglas
Fairmile, impatiently. “You can’t expect us to sit here
all night merely to look at you, can you?”</p>

<p>Freddie cleared his throat again, and launched
into his exposition; but the two interruptions had
flustered him a little and he failed to make his points
tell as heavily as he had hoped.</p>

<p>“You all know the Dangerfield Talisman’s
disappeared. The burglar alarms were all found
correctly set in the morning, so obviously nobody could
have got into the house from the outside. That
limits the thing down to the people in the house. I
think that’s plain.”</p>

<p>“Quite plain,” commented Westenhanger.
“Self-evident, in fact. Proceed, Freddie.”</p>

<p>“The inmates of the house can be divided into
three . . .”</p>

<p>“Just like ancient Gaul, eh?” Douglas explained.</p>

<p>Freddie scowled at the interruption and repeated
his phrases.</p>

<p>“The inmates can be divided into three groups.
First, there’s the Dangerfields themselves; second,
the servants; third, the guests—ourselves. The
Dangerfields don’t come into the matter. There’s
no reason why any of them should take away the
Talisman. Then it’s a fact that none of the servants
can be suspected. At least, so the Dangerfields say,
and they ought to know. That leaves ourselves.
One of us must have taken it.”</p>

<p>He glanced round the group in the hope that, even
at this early stage in the inquiry, someone might
betray himself. Morchard was leaning back in his
chair, lazily following the movement of a
smoke-ring which he had blown by accident. Mrs. Caistor
Scorton was obviously bored. Nina and Cynthia
were trying to repress smiles—evidently the results
of some whispered aside by Douglas which Freddie
had failed to catch. As for Wraxall, even an expert
poker-player could have made nothing of his
inscrutable mask. Eileen Cressage looked white and
tired; and there was something in her face that
encouraged Freddie to think that here he had found
the weak point in the circle. Quite evidently she
dreaded something to come, but she seemed to be
hoping that the danger might yet be averted.
Westenhanger, of course, showed nothing, since he
was the solitary individual whose innocence was
beyond doubt.</p>

<p>“Now there are two possible explanations of the
Talisman’s disappearance,” Freddie continued.
“One is, that it’s due to a practical joke. We all
know how the Dangerfields boast about taking no
precautions with the Talisman. Somebody here may
have wanted to give them a lesson about that.
That’s a possibility. But if that’s the explanation,
I think we have something to say. Joke or no joke,
the thing’s gone, and until it turns up again, every
one of us is under suspicion of theft. Everyone
of us!”</p>

<p>He glanced round the faces once more, but still no
one betrayed any definite sign of guilt. Eileen
Cressage’s expression puzzled him. She looked up
and caught his eyes for a moment, but it was he who
turned away first, so manifest was the dislike in her
glance. Quite evidently the girl had something to
conceal, and Freddie grew more determined to bring
it to light, whatever it was.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Mr. Stickney!” the American
interrupted as Freddie was about to continue. “Let’s
be accurate, if <em>you</em> please. You said ‘Everyone of
us.’ That’s not correct. Mr. Westenhanger can’t
be included. He couldn’t have had any hand in the
affair, on your own showing.”</p>

<p>The engineer acknowledged the American’s
statement with a quick smile. Wraxall, evidently, was a
kindred spirit, bent on spoiling Freddie’s little effects.</p>

<p>“Very well,” snapped Freddie. “Then it’s one of
us here, excluding Westenhanger.”</p>

<p>Rather to Westenhanger’s surprise, Morchard
joined the critics.</p>

<p>“Wrong again,” he declared, weightily. “Mrs.
Brent was in the house that night; and she isn’t here.
I agree with Mr. Wraxall. Let’s be accurate.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” snarled Freddie, “have it as you like.
The main point is that everyone here, bar one, is
under suspicion. And whether it’s a practical joke
or not, it looks like plain theft. And that’s a very
unpleasant business, very unpleasant to us all—to
myself at any rate. It’s very unfair. And if this
thing isn’t cleared up as soon as possible it’ll leave a
permanent stain on our characters. You know how
people talk.”</p>

<p>“I hear you, Freddie,” interjected Douglas, and
Freddie was annoyed to see Nina Lindale’s lips
twitch in a repressed smile.</p>

<p>“It’s no laughing matter,” he said, indignantly.
“Far from it. Somebody in Friocksheim took the
Talisman, that’s certain. Now all I suggest is that
we should each voluntarily account for our time
during the period when the thing was stolen. That’s
no hardship to anyone. I’m quite glad to do it
myself; and I’m sure everyone else in my position will
be just as glad. If anyone here took the Talisman,
let him say so now and we won’t need to go any
further.”</p>

<p>He fixed his eye on Douglas Fairmile as he spoke,
more by accident than design.</p>

<p>“Meaning me?” inquired Douglas. “Try again,
doggie. You’re barking up the wrong tree. I never
touched the thing in my life.”</p>

<p>Freddie ignored the interruption.</p>

<p>“Nobody admits they did it as a joke?” he
demanded. “Then it’s much worse. It’s theft, pure
and simple. We owe it to ourselves to clear the
thing up. At any rate, that’s my view, and I think
it will be the view of everybody in my position
to-night.”</p>

<p>To Freddie’s surprise Morchard came to his
assistance.</p>

<p>“There’s something in that,” he admitted. “I
doubt if it’ll lead to anything; but since the thing’s
been allowed to go so far, I don’t see any harm in
letting anyone who wishes it, do as you suggest.”</p>

<p>Freddie, looking at Eileen Cressage, saw her shoot
a glance at Morchard; but as she turned her head
to do so, he could not see her expression. When
she turned back again he had no difficulty in reading
consternation in her face. She detected that he was
watching her and endeavoured, with very little
success, to assume an indifferent attitude.
Westenhanger also had caught the by-play, and his face
clouded.</p>

<p>“Suppose you begin, then,” Freddie suggested to
Morchard.</p>

<p>Morchard seemed rather annoyed at being directly
attacked, but he gave a nod of acquiescence.</p>

<p>“Most of us went upstairs together, you
remember. That would be about a quarter to twelve
or so. I didn’t look at my watch, so I can’t make
it closer. Anyway, it must have been about then.
We’ve always been pretty early at Friocksheim.
Then I undressed and went to bed—midnight, say.
And I woke up as usual in the morning. That’s all.
Help you much, Stickney?”</p>

<p>Freddie ignored the query and glanced round to
see if anyone else would volunteer. Mrs. Caistor
Scorton sat up in her chair.</p>

<p>“I went to my room as usual—about a quarter
to twelve, as Mr. Morchard says. Some people
came up a little later. I heard steps in the corridor
and the sounds of doors shutting. There was some
talking in low voices and more doors shut. Then
the whole house was quiet. I looked out of the
window for a short time, wondering if the storm was
coming at last. Then I heard a noise as if someone
had stumbled on the mat outside my door. I opened
the door quietly and looked out. It was Miss
Cressage. She was carrying a lighted candle and by
the time I got the door open she was a good distance
down the passage. I didn’t call after her, but just
shut my door again. I looked at my watch to see
how late it was, and I remember it was a quarter
past twelve. After a time I undressed and went to
bed. The next thing I can remember is waking up
as usual.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger was completely taken aback by this
evidence. What could a girl be doing, wandering
about the house at that time of night? Almost
without thinking, he swung round on Mrs. Caistor
Scorton and put a question.</p>

<p>“You’re sure it was Miss Cressage?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure,” said Mrs. Caistor Scorton,
composedly. “She was wearing her dressing-gown and
bedroom slippers. No one else has a silk
dressing-gown of that shade.”</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage had gone very white during Mrs.
Caistor Scorton’s evidence, but she made no
comment. Westenhanger, looking at her momentarily,
saw that she had been completely surprised. At
the same time, her attitude suggested that she might
have something in reserve though she was not very
confident about it. Freddie Stickney in his turn put
a question to Mrs. Caistor Scorton.</p>

<p>“You said she was ‘going down the passage.’
What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“Miss Cressage’s room is beyond mine. She was
going away from it when I saw her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Freddie. “You mean that she
was going along the corridor in the direction of the
bachelor’s wing?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger saw Eileen start in her chair at this
elucidation by Freddie, but she evidently held
herself in with an almost physical effort.</p>

<p>“Why on earth doesn’t she say something?” he
wondered to himself. “I’d stake my money that
she’s straight, and yet she lets that little swine
go on unchecked with his insinuations. I can’t
understand it.”</p>

<p>Whether she wished it or not, Mrs. Caistor
Scorton had changed the whole atmosphere. Up to the
moment when she began to speak, the affair had been
handled in an almost frivolous spirit. Freddie
Stickney had been making a fool of himself, and no
one liked him sufficiently to feel troubled by that
aspect of the matter. Even the Talisman theft had
not weighed over heavily as a personal thing, for
nobody had any formulated suspicions in his mind.
But Mrs. Caistor Scorton, in half a dozen sentences,
had brought them face to face with a new problem,
and the silence of the girl made it difficult to find
innocuous explanations. Something ugly had reared
up in the midst of what, to most of them, had been
little more than a joke. Eileen’s white, strained
face, and her attitude of a creature at bay, had taken
away all humour from the situation. Freddie
Stickney had achieved a masterpiece in the creation
of discomfort. Westenhanger could see Douglas
Fairmile’s face, and in its expression he read the
twin of his own feelings.</p>

<p>The American broke the silence, before its
awkwardness grew too obvious.</p>

<p>“You mean that Miss Cressage was going towards
the head of the main stair-case, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton nodded without speaking.</p>

<p>“I understand it better when it’s put in that way,”
said Wraxall, bluntly.</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage threw him a glance in which
Westenhanger recognised gratitude. The American
had taken the edge off the situation, to some extent,
by his intervention. But a moment’s reflection
showed Westenhanger that Wraxall had merely
turned the matter into a fresh and difficult channel.
Down the stair-case was the way to the Corinthian’s
Room and the Talisman.</p>

<p>Before anyone else could interpose comments,
Wraxall again threw himself into the breach:</p>

<p>“My tale’s more elaborate than these two. It’ll
take longer to tell, I expect. I went upstairs to
bed with the rest of the party, but I didn’t undress
just then. I felt that storm coming up, and I like
storms. I wouldn’t miss one. So I just sat at my
window. My room’s the second on the corridor
in the bachelor’s wing, as you go along from the
stair-case. Yours is the first, isn’t it, Mr.
Westenhanger?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m next you.”</p>

<p>“Your room was empty, that night, so anyone
going along the corridor had to pass my door before
they got to any other room. I was wide awake, at
my window. I’ve pretty sharp ears, and I was
listening hard for the first of the thunder. I heard
nobody pass my door. I’d have heard anyone in
the corridor. Make a note of that, Mr. Stickney.
It seems important.”</p>

<p>He broke off and glanced contemptuously at
Freddie.</p>

<p>“At almost exactly half-past twelve,” he went on,
“the storm broke. I looked at my watch at the
first thunder-clap. It was a good storm. I’ve
seldom seen better. But from my point of view it was
rather a failure, just then. I couldn’t see well
enough out of my window. I was losing half of
it. So I got up—I hadn’t undressed—and I took
my candle with me because I didn’t know where
the corridor switches were. Nor the switches
in the hall below. I’d failed to make a note of
them.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment as though expecting
comments, but no one said anything.</p>

<p>“I went downstairs. I wanted to get outside if I
could. I didn’t mean to lose any of that storm. At
the main door, I had a glance at the burglar alarm.
It’s the same pattern as I use in my own house, so
I put it out of action and opened the door. It was
quite dry outside then. The rain hadn’t started.
So I went out.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger was struck by an idea.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Mr. Wraxall. That meant you
left the door open behind you, didn’t it? Could
anyone have got in without you seeing him?”</p>

<p>Wraxall nodded approval.</p>

<p>“No, nobody could have got in. I had my eye on
the door all the time. I was never away from it.
To continue: The whole house-front was dark when
I went outside, except for some windows in the little
tower above the Corinthian’s Room. They were lit
up.”</p>

<p>“That’s Eric Dangerfield’s room,” interjected
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“Quite right. You’ll hear more about that when
I come to it, but let’s take things as they happened.
Almost as soon as I got outside there was a terrific
flash—blinding. And then the father and mother
of all the thunder-claps. I found in the morning it
had struck one of the trees near by. That was at
twelve thirty-nine p.m. exact—I looked at my watch
by the next flash which came immediately after.”</p>

<p>“That must have been the peal that frightened
me,” Nina interjected. “It was the loudest I ever
heard.”</p>

<p>“Within a minute or two,” continued Wraxall, “a
light went up at the end of the east wing.”</p>

<p>“That was in my room,” confirmed Cynthia
Pennard.</p>

<p>“We can ignore it for the present, then,” said
Wraxall. “I’m just giving you what I saw. About
five minutes later—that would be about ten minutes
to one by rough reckoning—a light appeared in the
Corinthian’s Room——”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Freddie Stickney. “This is
getting hotter.”</p>

<p>“Only another of your mare’s nests, Freddie,”
explained Douglas. “It was I who switched that on.”</p>

<p>Wraxall continued without taking any notice.</p>

<p>“I saw a light in the Corinthian’s Room and—as
I was about to say when Mr. Stickney cut in—in
the library which leads out of the Corinthian’s
Room. Five minutes later, say about one o’clock in
the morning, the rain drove me indoors. I bolted
the door and put on the alarm again. As I came
back into the hall, someone switched on the lights,
and I found young Dangerfield there. I said
something about having been out looking at the storm and
he nodded. Then I went upstairs and back to my
room. The best part of the storm was over, so I
went to bed, perhaps round about quarter past one.
Like the other people I woke up as usual in the
morning. That’s all I can remember at present.”</p>

<p>The American’s narrative, whether intentionally
or not, had brought a relaxation of the tension in the
room. By his purely objective treatment of the
matter he had produced an unconscious change in
outlook among his audience. Westenhanger was
relieved to see that even Eileen’s face had taken on
a less strained expression. She was anything but at
her ease, yet there was something in her face which
suggested that she had passed the worst.</p>

<p>Douglas Fairmile was the next to volunteer an
account of his doings during the night.</p>

<p>“I’m no great hand at exact times and seasons,”
he began. “You’ll just need to take what you get.
And I’m no amateur in storms, either. If lightning
leaves me alone I’ll never trouble it. But that storm
forced itself on my notice—and not in a quiet
insinuating way, either. To be frank with you, it
kept me awake. After a while I got fed up listening
to it, so I thought I might as well read, since I
couldn’t sleep. So I padded off downstairs to get
a book from the library. Mr. Wraxall says it was
just about one o’clock, and he knows more about it
than I do. The only thing that strikes me as
important in the affair is that when I switched on the
lights in the Corinthian’s Room, I happened to
notice that the Talisman was still in its place. So
that means it disappeared after one o’clock in the
morning.”</p>

<p>He glanced at Eileen as he spoke. Westenhanger
felt a wave of relief at this evidence, since it seemed
to clear the girl completely; but on looking at her,
he was surprised to see that she showed no sign of
elation. Her expression hardly indicated that she
had appreciated the force of Douglas’s statement.</p>

<p>“I picked up a book,” continued Douglas, “and
just as I was leaving the room, Eric came down his
stair. We exchanged a few bright remarks about
the storm—nothing worth recording—and I left him
writing something at the table in the library. I
must have got through the hall—I didn’t bother to
switch on the lights—before Mr. Wraxall came
inside again. And so to bed. And may I repeat,
Freddie, lest you failed to catch my whisper last
time, that I did <em>not</em> steal the Talisman as I was
passing. Make a note of that. It seems important, as
Mr. Wraxall says.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid my story doesn’t help much,” said
Nina Lindale, shyly, “and it makes me out to be a
terrible coward. But I’ve always been nervous of
thunder since I was a kiddie. I didn’t mind the
beginning of this one—at least I tried not to mind
it. But then there came a terrific flash and a
perfectly awful peal of thunder, and my nerves went to
pieces altogether.”</p>

<p>“That must have been the time the tree was
struck, I expect,” said the American. “Say twenty
minutes to one?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t ask me what time it was. I had other
things to think about. After that, I felt I simply
couldn’t be alone for another minute. I got up and
went next door into Eileen’s room. I wanted
company at any price, even if I had to knock up half
the house to get it. But Eileen wasn’t there. Her
bed hadn’t been slept in. So I thought perhaps she
was in the same state and had gone to someone else’s
room. I rushed along to Cynthia’s bedroom and
burst in on her. And after that I didn’t dare to
go back to my own room again, so I just stayed with
her all night.”</p>

<p>“That accounts for my light being switched on,
you see, Mr. Wraxall,” said Cynthia to the
American. “I’ve really no idea of what time it was that
Nina came along to me; but it was just after that
awful thunder-clap; and I expect that was the one
you made a note of. Nina and I fell asleep after a
while, once the storm had gone down. I don’t know
what time that was, either. Do you generally fall
asleep with your eyes on your watch, Mr. Stickney?
It seems very hard to fix any definite times for things
which happen at night.”</p>

<p>Freddie smiled in a superior fashion.</p>

<p>“As it happens, I did look at my watch in the
middle of the night. I went to bed at the same time
as the rest; and went to sleep, too, which is more
than some of you seem to have been able to do. I
slept through the storm. But later on the wind got
up. My window-blind began to flap badly; and that
woke me up. I looked at the time to see if it was
worth while getting out of bed and fixing it, or
whether it wasn’t worth while. That was at twenty
minutes to three, I remember distinctly.”</p>

<p>He glanced at Cynthia triumphantly. She took
up the implied challenge at once.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Stickney, you’ve given us <em>one</em> time.
But you haven’t told us when you went to sleep.
It seems to me you’re no better than the rest of us,
really.”</p>

<p>Freddie ignored her and continued his tale.</p>

<p>“I made up my mind to get up and fix the blind.
That was at twenty minutes to three, as I said.
While I was at the window, I looked out. My room
looks right across the court-yard to the windows of
Miss Lindale’s room. As I was standing at the
window, a light went up in the windows next to Miss
Lindale’s.”</p>

<p>He paused, and Westenhanger saw by his
expression that he hoped to spring a surprise. Freddie
swung round suddenly upon Eileen.</p>

<p>“That’s your room, isn’t it, Miss Cressage?”</p>

<p>The girl’s face showed that this was the piece of
evidence which she had been dreading; but she
managed to keep her voice under control as she answered.</p>

<p>“My room is next Nina’s, and I did switch on my
light sometime in the small hours. I didn’t look at
the time, but no doubt you’re quite right about it.”</p>

<p>Again the atmosphere had grown tense.
Westenhanger swiftly scanned the girl’s face, and he was
distressed to see how haggard she seemed. “She
looks just like a trapped animal,” he thought in the
first flash. Then some unidentifiable trait in her
expression brought a second idea to the fore. “She
looks as though she knew she’s in a very tight
corner; but she expects to pull out of it somehow in the
end. She’s pretty nearly desperate—but not quite.”</p>

<p>Freddie, having drawn general attention to
Eileen’s attitude, contented himself with completing
his story.</p>

<p>“I looked out of my window for a short time after
fixing the blind so that it wouldn’t flap again. After
that I went back to bed again and fell asleep almost
immediately. I waked up at the usual time.”</p>

<p>He waited for a moment and then added:</p>

<p>“Now if we had Miss Cressage’s story we should
have had everybody’s version of the affair.”</p>

<p>Eileen rose to her feet, and they could see that
she was trembling, though she kept herself under
control. Westenhanger instinctively leaned forward
in his chair. If the girl had some trump card in her
hand, now was the time to play it. If not, then
undoubtedly Freddie Stickney had put her in a bad
position. She had left her room at a quarter past
twelve. Freddie’s evidence pointed to her coming
back again at twenty minutes to three in the
morning, and switching on her light as she re-entered her
room. What could any girl be doing out of her bed
at that time of night, and for two hours at a stretch?
And, undoubtedly, from the evidence of Douglas,
the Talisman might have disappeared during the
time she was moving about the house. No matter
where she had been, it looked a bad business; and
yet Westenhanger could not help feeling that there
must be some explanation.</p>

<p>“That girl’s straight,” he repeated to himself.
“She’s over-straight, if anything, by the look of her.
And yet she’s got herself into some deadly hole or
other.”</p>

<p>Then an idea suddenly flashed into his mind.</p>

<p>“Suppose she’s shielding someone else! I never
thought of that! But it would need to be a pretty
strong motive that would make her take the thing
as she has taken it.”</p>

<p>Before he could follow out this train of thought,
Eileen’s voice broke in on his reflections.</p>

<p>“I really haven’t anything to say. It’s quite true
that Mrs. Caistor Scorton saw me in the corridor
after twelve o’clock. I didn’t know she had seen
me then. And it’s quite true that I switched on my
light when I came back again. I don’t know what
time it was then, but probably Mr. Stickney is quite
right. It doesn’t matter much. I wasn’t near the
Talisman during the night. That’s all I can tell
you.”</p>

<p>Her control suddenly broke, and she moved
hastily towards the door. Douglas Fairmile sprang up
and opened it for her to pass out. As she passed
him, she could read in his face that he at least was
quite prepared to take her word.</p>

<p>As the door closed behind her, the atmosphere of
strain grew more intense. The realisation that they
had narrowly escaped a nasty scene weighed upon
the group; and no one seemed eager to break the
silence. At last Westenhanger, feeling that the first
note struck was of importance, swung round on
Freddie Stickney. He ignored the events of the last
few moments completely.</p>

<p>“Well, Freddie,” he said, coldly, “your inquest
doesn’t seem to have led to much. I can’t
congratulate you. Speaking purely as a bystander, I can’t
say that you’ve achieved anything. Take your own
case. You went to bed at some unspecified hour.
You say you slept through that storm. That’s quite
possible; though some of us might have difficulty
in believing you, if I can judge from the accounts
I’ve heard of the thunder. At any rate, you tell us
you waked up shortly before three o’clock and were
actually out of bed at that time—<em>just the period
when the Talisman was stolen</em>. You were up and
about for some unspecified time. Then you went
back to bed and fell asleep again. Quite all right
no doubt.”</p>

<p>His voice grew more incisive.</p>

<p>“But if you think you’ve cleared yourself of
suspicion by telling that tale, I may as well sweep away
your illusions. If a detective were working on this
case, he’d simply ignore your whole yarn—except
one solitary point. He’d take Miss Cressage’s word
that she switched on the light in her room, and he’d
believe you when you say you saw that light go up.
That’s the only point where there’s the slightest
confirmation. And Miss Cressage is the only person
who could clear you, if it happened to turn out that
the Talisman disappeared about three o’clock in the
morning.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.</p>

<p>“You seem to have the foggiest notion of evidence,
Freddie. Anyone could have foreseen this sort of
thing. Even a child would know that at night, in
a house like this, it’s almost impossible to establish
a decent alibi. Nina and Cynthia are the only two
of you who have established cast-iron alibis; and
that was due to a pure accident—the thunderstorm.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said Wraxall, before Freddie could
reply. “That’s quite correct, Mr. Westenhanger.
Nobody could get an alibi under these conditions, in
the normal way. I quite agree with you that this
little playlet hasn’t been a success. By no means.
I think we’d be well advised to forget all about it.”</p>

<p>Douglas Fairmile laughed at the sight of Freddie’s
expression; and with that laugh, the tension was
released again. Douglas’s mirth seemed infectious,
following so closely on the strain of the last quarter
of an hour.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you can’t suspect me,” said Nina
Lindale with a faint smile. “I never thought a
thunderstorm would clear my character. I suppose
I ought to be thankful.”</p>

<p>“Ditto!” added Cynthia, lightly.</p>

<p>Westenhanger returned to the attack in a sardonic
tone.</p>

<p>“One thing I noticed, Freddie: You didn’t go
the length of denying that you stole the Talisman
yourself. An oversight, probably. Oh, don’t
trouble to do it now; it would look rather too much
like an after-thought. Besides, no detective would
take your word for it—with that look on your face.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Detected Guilt, or The Sinner Unmasked’—what?”
jeered Douglas. “Freddie, you’d make the
fortune of a problem painter if he got hold of you
just now. ‘Did He Do It?’ That would be the
title. Picture of the wily fellow who takes charge of
the whole investigation and then leads all the sleuths
on the wrong scent while he makes off with the swag,
eh? Priceless!”</p>

<p>The three men had turned the tables on Freddie,
and he had the wit to recognise the fact. The whole
effect of his efforts had been nullified by this last
touch of ridicule, which made a special appeal after
the earlier tension. He nodded sulkily, as though
admitting an error; but he made no direct reply to
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>Nina Lindale gave the signal for the company to
break up.</p>

<p>“I’m off to bed,” she announced, unsuccessfully
trying to conceal a yawn. “I got very little sleep
last night, and if I stay up any longer I shall doze
off in my chair.”</p>

<p>“That’s a sound idea, Miss Lindale,” said Wraxall.
“I begin to remember that I lost some sleep too,
last night.”</p>

<p>Morchard and Mrs. Caistor Scorton joined the
group which was moving toward the door. Cynthia
linked her arm in Nina’s and was turning away
when Douglas called her back and spoke to her in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“What a thoughtful child it is!” they heard her
say, in mock admiration. “And did you imagine I
hadn’t thought of that long ago? Don’t worry!”</p>

<p>She hurried after her companion. Freddie
Stickney, left alone with Douglas and Westenhanger,
shuffled for a moment or two and then retired to the
door.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bed,” he said, reaching for the
handle.</p>

<p>“Right, Freddie,” said Douglas, making a
pretence of consulting his watch. “I’ve taken the time.
Set your alarm clock every quarter of an hour and
jot down that you were in bed each time when you
woke up. It’ll be an invaluable memorandum if
anything happens to go astray to-night. Bye-bye.
If you feel one of your ears burning, don’t fret. It
will probably be me saying what I think of your
exploits.”</p>

<p>Freddie suppressed a snarl and went out.
Westenhanger dropped into a big lounge-chair and pulled
out his pipe.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Douglas; it’s early yet.”</p>

<p>Douglas picked out a convenient seat, near enough
to allow a low-voiced conversation.</p>

<p>“I asked Cynthia to drop into Eileen’s room and
tell her what we thought of things. Couldn’t leave
the girl imagining we believed she was a wrong ’un,
could we? And she might have thought that, cutting
off when she did. Cynthia was going to see her
off her own bat, it seems. Sound girl, Cynthia;
she’ll do it tactfully. Some people might make a
bad break in a case like that.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger acquiesced silently, and filled his
pipe before he spoke again.</p>

<p>“Damnable business, that,” he said at last. “And
if we’d stopped it, there would have been some sort
of scene. Everyone’s nerves were on edge.
Anything was better than that. But what actually
happened wasn’t so very much better after all. That
girl was as near cracking up as she could be. If it
hadn’t been for her grit, we might have had a much
nastier affair on our hands.”</p>

<p>“One would like to wring Freddie’s neck, of
course,” Douglas mused aloud; “but that would
mean a row. We can’t have rows. With luck, we
can stifle this business; but a row would make it
anybody’s news. Freddie gets off this time, I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>“He does. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“The infernal thing is that the little sweep’s right,
you know, Conway. We <em>are</em> all under suspicion.
I don’t suspect anyone myself—not my line. But
there’s no getting away from it. Someone did take
that damned Talisman.”</p>

<p>“Afraid so. The only hope that I have is that it
may have been a practical joke after all, and that
the joker was afraid to own up. Trusted to putting
the thing back again without being spotted.”</p>

<p>“Possible, of course,” conceded Douglas. “But I
can’t identify the prize idiot.”</p>

<p>“Nor can I. Well, take the other thing and see
if it leads you any further—theft, I mean. I’m out
of it, by pure luck. You’ve all the money you want.
Morchard has more than’s good for him. The
Scorton woman is rolling in it. I take it that the
girls don’t come into question?”</p>

<p>He glanced interrogatively at Douglas, who
nodded his agreement.</p>

<p>“Then that leaves the American and Freddie as
a residue. Know anything about Wraxall,
Douglas?”</p>

<p>“Nix, as I suppose he’d say. He’s a collector, of
sorts, and rolling in money, I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” said Westenhanger, pausing for a
moment.</p>

<p>“Well, pass Wraxall,” he continued. “That
leaves us with Freddie. I don’t like Freddie. I’ve
nothing against his morals, for I know nothing about
them. I do know he’s hard up, though. But I’ve
been hard up myself at times. That doesn’t
necessarily make a black mark on one’s record.”</p>

<p>“True,” Douglas agreed. Then after a few
seconds he added: “Know the Scots verdict <i>Not
Proven</i>, Conway? ‘The accused was discharged
with a stain on his character. All saved, bar
honour.’ That’s how you feel about Freddie, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“I’m not very friendly. The way that girl was
baited to-night was enough to sicken any decent
person. But there’s a difference between feeling
like that and calling the little beast a thief, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Not Proven; that’s so.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger considered for a few moments as
though he found it difficult to choose words for what
he had to say. At last he put down his pipe.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing, Douglas—that girl has got to
be cleared. We’re all mixed up in <em>that</em> affair, thanks
to Freddie’s infernal manœuvres; we can’t shirk
responsibility. I don’t know what possessed her to
go roaming about the house at that time of night.
Still less can I imagine why she couldn’t tell us what
she was after. But she’s a straight girl, if ever I
saw one, and we simply can’t afford to let things rest
as they are. I don’t want to know what she was
doing—and I don’t much care. But the only way
to clear her is to find out who actually did the trick.
It’ll be a stiff business.”</p>

<p>Douglas looked serious.</p>

<p>“Stiff enough, if you ask me. If you want a
Watson, I’m your man; but you’ll need to supply
the Sherlocking yourself. I simply haven’t the
brains for it. The whole affair is a complete
mystery—and likely to remain so, for all the help I
could give.”</p>

<p>“I’m not hopeful,” confessed Westenhanger at
once. “The only detecting I ever did was guessing
what cards were in my opponents’ hands. It’s not
so much I expect to get anything out, Douglas. I
feel one has to turn to and do what one can, or else
I shouldn’t be comfortable. That girl’s face wasn’t
a happy sight to-night. It’s got rather on my
nerves, if you want to know.”</p>

<p>He took up his pipe again. Douglas said nothing,
but his face showed that he understood
Westenhanger’s account of his feelings.</p>

<p>“What do you make of Wraxall?” Westenhanger
demanded, abruptly.</p>

<p>“Decent soul, I thought. Backed us up well in
the matter of sitting on Freddie.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger made no comment. Douglas let
him smoke in silence for a while before inquiring:</p>

<p>“What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Wraxall was the only one of you who had a
complete story ready to account for all his doings during
the night. That’s my impression about Wraxall,
Douglas.”</p>

<h2>Chapter VII</h2>

<p>Cynthia Pennard moved slightly to avoid a spot
of light which had crept across the cushions of her
hammock until it reached her face.</p>

<p>“Douglas,” she said, lazily, “has a hippopotamus
got a tougher hide than a rhinoceros? I’d like to
know.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard them both well spoken of—highly
commended, in fact. I’d hate to draw an invidious
distinction and cause trouble at the Zoo. But why
this lust for general information? It’s not like you.”</p>

<p>Following her glance across the broad lawn,
Douglas caught sight of Freddie Stickney sitting on
the grass beside Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s garden-chair.
Cynthia turned her head again.</p>

<p>“That’s quite the thickest-skinned creature I ever
heard of,” she explained, “and I was only wondering
which animal ought to come after him.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you spend the day better than in thinking
up insults to rhinoceroses and hippopotami? They’d
wilt with shame if they dreamed you were putting
them in Freddie’s class. No flies on Freddie, as
they say. Why so? Because they’d merely blunt
their beaks if they tried to get through his hide.
His fair companion’s pretty tough on the surface,
too. Perhaps that’s why all the gnats have moved
over here. Suppose we disappoint ’em by going
down to the tennis-courts?”</p>

<p>Cynthia slipped neatly out of her hammock, and
they went off together.</p>

<p>There was more than a grain of truth in their
comments. Freddie Stickney prided himself—and
justly—upon one knightly quality: he never showed
a wound. The most brutal snubbing left him quite
unabashed. Coming down to breakfast after the
fiasco of his “inquest,” he had encountered Eileen
Cressage at the head of the stairs, and he had
insisted on chattering trivialities to her all the way
down. At table, his beady eyes had wholly failed
to see the marked coldness with which he was treated
by everyone, and he took no notice of the fact that
all conversations into which he inserted himself were
apt almost immediately to fade out into silence.
Only Mrs. Caistor Scorton seemed to recognise his
existence, and when breakfast was over, he had
sought her out on the lawns.</p>

<p>“What do you think about this affair of the
Talisman, Mrs. Caistor Scorton?” he demanded, as he
sat down on the turf beside her chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton seemed to ruminate for some
moments before replying. Then she glanced
shrewdly at Freddie. Evidently she thought it
worth while to draw him out.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, Mr. Stickney. I’m not clever,
like you; and I can make nothing of it, one way
or the other. But I’d like to hear what you think.
You’ve been putting two and two together, I’m
sure, and I expect you’ve got a good idea of
things.”</p>

<p>Freddie rose to the bait without hesitation.</p>

<p>“If it would interest you, I’m delighted to give
you my inferences. You’ve got all the facts
already.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton nodded, but said nothing.
Freddie corrected himself immediately.</p>

<p>“No, I was wrong in saying that. I’ve been
hunting out some more evidence—things that didn’t come
out last night. One or two points seem to be
important.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton became more alert.</p>

<p>“That sounds interesting, Mr. Stickney. I’d like
to hear it.”</p>

<p>Freddie considered for a few moments.</p>

<p>“I was just trying to arrange it in my mind,” he
explained. “The easiest way will be to take each
person in turn, and examine the evidence we have
about that person in particular. Take Eileen
Cressage first. I think it’s obvious that some of us know
more about her affairs than came out last night.”</p>

<p>He looked up into Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s face
inquisitively as he spoke, and his voice had a hint
of interrogation in its tone. Mrs. Caistor Scorton
stared down at him unwinkingly.</p>

<p>“One would almost think you were connecting me
with her, Mr. Stickney. I hardly know her.”</p>

<p>“Well, correct me if I am wrong,” said Freddie,
brightly. “I admit some of it’s guesswork; but I
believe I’m right. We’ll see. Now to start with,
she’s hard up. That’s common knowledge.
People invite her to their houses out of good nature, and
she stays with them to save money, living on the
cheap.”</p>

<p>No one would have imagined, from Freddie’s
semi-indignant, semi-pitying tone, that this
description accurately fitted his own methods during part
of the year.</p>

<p>“I believe that’s true,” said Mrs. Caistor Scorton,
in a judicial voice. “It’s common knowledge, as
you say. What next?”</p>

<p>“She lost a lot of money to you at bridge the
other night.”</p>

<p>“That’s common knowledge too, Mr. Stickney.
Everyone in the room knew that. Are these your
wonderful revelations?”</p>

<p>The quite perceptible ring of disappointment in
her tone touched Freddie on the raw. He was put
on his metal, just as she intended.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” he begged. “Let’s take things
as they come. She didn’t pay you at the time?
No. She gave you a cheque. I was watching her
face closely just then. I’m a bit of physiognomist,
you know. It was plain as print to me. That
cheque was no good, Mrs. Caistor Scorton.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton regarded him with a rather
malicious smile.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Mr. Stickney?” She laughed. “Then
how do you account for the fact that the cheque
was met when it was presented? I paid it in
immediately and my bank collected it at once.”</p>

<p>Freddie Stickney held up his hand, asking
permission to interrupt her.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, rapidly, “I suppose the cheque was
met next day. But all the same, she hadn’t a spare
£200 in the world that night. I know the signs:
you can’t deceive me. She hadn’t the cash that
night. But she had it next day. What happened
in between?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?”</p>

<p>Freddie took no notice. His question had been
merely a rhetorical one. He continued, marking
each point with emphasis.</p>

<p>“The Talisman disappeared; that’s what
happened in between. And during the night, we know
that Miss Eileen Cressage was out of her room at
a time when the Talisman might have been stolen.
There’s no denying that, is there? And what
happened first thing next morning? Long before half
of us were up, she went off to town. And where
did Westenhanger run across her in town? Coming
out of Starbecks the jewellers, the place where they’ll
make advances on any little trinket you’ve no
immediate use for. And your cheque was met all
right.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and Mrs. Caistor
Scorton looked down at him curiously.</p>

<p>“You seem very good at putting two and two
together, Mr. Stickney. Do you enjoy it?”</p>

<p>Freddie seemed rather annoyed at the
interruption. It ruined the dramatic pause he had planned
to make before his summing up.</p>

<p>“Of course I enjoy it,” he replied, rather crossly.
“I like using my brains. Well, there’s the case.
It seems to me to need more explaining away than
we’ve had so far.”</p>

<p>“It’s very ingenious,” said Mrs. Caistor Scorton,
in a non-committal tone, “but isn’t there some other
possible explanation of things? One mustn’t look
at a thing from one side, too much, you know.”</p>

<p>Freddie was not a person who welcomed criticism
of his pronouncements; but he felt that his
reputation as a man of ideas was at stake. Swiftly his
mind reverted to an incident of the previous night.</p>

<p>“There is another possible explanation, I admit,”
he said, in a rather grudging tone. “Morchard has
plenty of money. A matter of £200 would be
nothing to him. Now he’s very keen on Miss Cressage’s
looks. I’ve watched him, and I know the signs.
Perhaps the money came from him. You said last
night that when you saw her she was going towards
the bachelors’ wing.”</p>

<p>“I said nothing of the kind,” Mrs. Caistor Scorton
interrupted sharply. “I said she was going along
the corridor.”</p>

<p>“Which leads to the bachelors’ wing, of course,”
persisted Freddie.</p>

<p>“And to the main staircase. Besides, Mr.
Wraxall said he heard no one pass his door.”</p>

<p>“How could he?” demanded Freddie
triumphantly. “You said she was wearing bedroom slippers.
She wouldn’t make a sound.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, Mr. Stickney,” Mrs. Caistor
Scorton commented in a colourless tone, “you seem to
have an unwholesome mind, if I may say it without
offence.” Her voice became indignant. “You know
precious little about girls if you think Eileen
Cressage would raise money in <em>that</em> particular way. I’m
not talking about morality; I’m speaking of
fastidiousness. If you’d suggested Douglas Fairmile,
it might have been credible; but it’s quite beyond
believing if you drag in Mr. Morchard. She simply
wouldn’t dream of it. There are some things a girl
of that type won’t do; and a cash bargain with Mr.
Morchard’s one of them.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Freddie, sullenly, “you can have
the other alternative if you prefer it.”</p>

<p>“It’s far more likely; I can tell you that,”
declared Mrs. Caistor Scorton, coldly.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s leave her alone and go on to the rest.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton nodded an abrupt
consent.</p>

<p>“Wraxall’s the next on the list,” Freddie went
on, recovering his good humour in the eagerness of
his dissection. “I’ve picked up some facts about
him too. He came here for one purpose, and one
purpose only. Do you know what that was? To
get the Talisman for his collection. That’s all he’s
here for. Now I found out—no matter how—that
on the night of the storm he approached old
Dangerfield and offered to buy the thing. Offered a
gigantic price for it. It didn’t come off. They wouldn’t
sell. So there he was, knowing he’d failed to get
what he wanted. You know what these collectors
are? Sort of monomaniacs on their hobby.”</p>

<p>“Are you suggesting that Mr. Wraxall took it?
Absurd!”</p>

<p>“I’m not suggesting anything. I’m simply
marshalling the evidence. What is there? We know
Wraxall was out and about in the house for the best
part of the night. What made Eric Dangerfield
come down from his room? Perhaps he heard
Wraxall wandering round near the foot of his stair
and frightened him off the first attempt on the
Talisman. Perhaps Wraxall came back again and
had a more successful try. All we know is that the
motive was there; the opportunity was there; the
theft was committed. Draw your own inference.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton seemed to have recovered
her earlier mood.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not so clever as you are, Mr. Stickney.
I’m quite content to hear your own views. Let’s
take the next person on your list.”</p>

<p>“Take Douglas Fairmile,” continued Freddie,
quite restored to good humour by the scrap of
flattery. “My deliberate judgment is that Douglas
is not guilty. First, there’s no motive. Douglas has
any amount of money; he doesn’t need the Talisman
for the sake of turning it into cash. Second, he
hasn’t the initiative to carry through a thing like
that. He’s just one of these would-be funny fellows.
No, in my opinion, it wasn’t Douglas.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” concurred Mrs. Caistor
Scorton. “Let’s pass on.”</p>

<p>“Morchard’s the next. Same thing. No motive.
No evidence. Morchard didn’t take it.”</p>

<p>“Anything to say about Mrs. Brent, Mr.
Stickney?”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Freddie importantly. “I have a piece
of fresh evidence about her. Two nights ago, I
happened to be passing outside the window when
she was discussing storms with that Yankee; and
do you know what I heard her say?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Caistor Scorton. “I don’t know.
I wish you wouldn’t go on asking these questions
when you know I can’t possibly answer them.”</p>

<p>Freddie ignored the interruption.</p>

<p>“I heard her say this,” he went on, impressively.</p>

<p>“ ‘After a really bad storm I’m hardly normal.
I might do something wild. <em>I might steal my best
friend’s spoons.</em>’ That’s what she said; I heard it
distinctly. Now what was the state of affairs on
the night the Talisman was stolen? Wasn’t it the
worst storm you’ve known for years?”</p>

<p>“It was,” agreed Mrs. Caistor Scorton, “quite the
worst. But remember that you slept through it
yourself. You told us so last night. So perhaps
Mrs. Brent did the same.”</p>

<p>“You’re trying to laugh at me,” Freddie’s tone
showed that he was hurt. “I’m sure Mrs. Brent
didn’t sleep through it. She hasn’t got my strong
nerves. No, I expect it drove her nearly out of
her mind. What if she stole something even more
important than her best friend’s spoons? Her room
was quite near the place where the Talisman stood.
What if she got up in the night with all her nerves
in rags, stole the Talisman, hid it somewhere—and
forgot all about it? And next morning she goes off
on the <i>Kestrel</i>, nobody knows where. What do you
think of that?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Mrs. Caistor Scorton, gently.
“Try again.”</p>

<p>Freddie looked at her dubiously for a moment
or two before continuing his survey.</p>

<p>“That leaves the two girls. But they have a
complete <i>alibi</i>, luckily for them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton looked at him quizzically as
he stopped.</p>

<p>“Your list isn’t complete yet, Mr. Stickney.
You’ve left out quite a number of possible people.
Myself, for one. Yourself, for another. And you’ve
forgotten the four Dangerfields. Let’s be quite fair
all round. What about these people?”</p>

<p>Freddie, for once, was completely taken aback.</p>

<p>“That’s only a joke, isn’t it? You didn’t actually
think . . .”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let us stumble over a trifle like that.
Let’s be fair all round.” Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s eyes
twinkled, but their expression was hardly kindly.
“Since you won’t do it, I’ll show you that you’ve
had a diligent pupil just now. I’ll follow your own
methods and you’ll criticise my efforts.”</p>

<p>Freddie uttered some protesting noises, but she
took no notice.</p>

<p>“First, there’s Mrs. Caistor Scorton. She had an
opportunity of stealing the Talisman. What about
motive? I understand she’s plenty of money.
She’d hardly be tempted by that. No motive?
Then shall we agree to pass Mrs. Caistor Scorton?
Very good.”</p>

<p>Her voice grew slightly acid.</p>

<p>“Then there’s Mr. Stickney. Opportunity? The
same as Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s. Motive?” She
turned on him swiftly. “You’re hard up, aren’t
you, Mr. Stickney? Yes? So I’ve heard people
say. People do talk, don’t they? Well, then, what
do you say about Mr. Stickney’s case? He had the
opportunity. He had a motive, we’ll say. And he
admitted last night that he was up and about just
at the very time when the Talisman was stolen.
Pass Mr. Stickney? Well . . . hardly, I think.
He’d better go back for further examination, hadn’t
he?”</p>

<p>Her laugh had a sarcastic ring in Freddie’s ears.
But before he had time to interrupt her, she had
passed on down her list.</p>

<p>“Now for the Dangerfields. All of them have
opportunity. What about motive? (You see how
apt a pupil I am, don’t you?) So far as the two old
people go, there’s no motive. They have the
Talisman already; they don’t need to steal it. Then
there’s Helga. Her fiancé’s big game shooting in
Africa just now. She’s going to get married when
he comes back. Big game shooting costs money. I
happen to know that he has plenty. Helga wouldn’t
need to steal the Talisman. Pass Helga Dangerfield,
I think.”</p>

<p>She glanced ironically at Freddie, who was
somewhat mystified by the turn of the examination.</p>

<p>“That’s the whole list, except for Eric
Dangerfield. Do you happen to have picked up anything
about him, Mr. Stickney?”</p>

<p>Freddie seemed to feel that his reputation as an
authority was at stake. His beady eyes took on a
meditative expression as he ran over his memory
for information.</p>

<p>“He’s Helga’s cousin, of course. And he’s the
nearest living male in the family. I suppose he’s
an heir-male or whatever they call it. Friocksheim
goes down the male line, I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“Nothing very new in all that, Mr. Stickney.
Don’t you know something about him personally?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” Freddie replied, doubtfully. “I’ve
never met him before I came here this time. He’s
been abroad till quite lately. A bit of a rolling
stone, from all I’ve heard. Remittance man, or
something like that.”</p>

<p>“A ne’er-do-well, then?”</p>

<p>“I think so. Most likely.”</p>

<p>“Any other pleasant characteristics you can think
of?”</p>

<p>Freddie hesitated for an instant, then apparently
he made up his mind to divulge something.</p>

<p>“Of course, Mrs. Caistor Scorton, this is
absolutely in confidence. You won’t repeat it?”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and he continued.</p>

<p>“He’s very hard up. I know that for a fact. I
happened to be walking in the garden that night
he was playing bridge with you. He and the old
man were talking; and I chanced to overhear some
things they said. Of course, I wasn’t listening on
purpose; but sometimes one can’t help catching a
sentence or two.”</p>

<p>Without giving his neighbour time to interrupt
him, he hurried on to his revelation.</p>

<p>“I gathered that Eric couldn’t pay up that night,
either. He was dunning his uncle for cash to square
up with Morchard. Old Mr. Dangerfield wasn’t
pleased. He said something about this being the
last time. At any rate he said ‘last time’; but
perhaps he was speaking of some other time, before
that. He seemed very hot about it. Eric wasn’t
looking very comfortable.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have heard a good deal,” said Mrs.
Caistor Scorton, indifferently.</p>

<p>But Freddie hardly seemed to notice her aloofness.
He was off on a fresh scent.</p>

<p>“I’d never thought of that,” he volunteered. “Of
course, that throws a fresh light on things. Let’s
see if we can put two and two together. Fact
number one, he’s hard up. Fact number two, he’s a
ne’er-do-well. Fact number three, he couldn’t pay
Morchard that night. Number four, he may not
have been able to persuade his uncle to pay.
Number five, he did pay after the Talisman
disappeared—I happen to know that. Problem, how did he
manage to pay? Well, suppose he took the
Talisman. He wouldn’t need to sell it. He could raise
some cash on it easily enough, being a Dangerfield.
He could get an advance and let them notify his
uncle. Old Mr. Dangerfield would be forced to pay
up in order to get the thing back. Or he might even
simply hide the thing and blackmail his uncle for
money—hold the Talisman to ransom, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“You have a wonderful imagination, Mr. Stickney.
I hope you’ll go on looking into the whole affair.
Perhaps you’ll be able to clear it up for us. It’s
certainly been most unpleasant to feel that this cloud
of suspicion is hanging over the place. You’ll do
your best, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>Freddie tried to appear modest under this
testimonial to his capacity.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve felt all along,” he admitted.
“One really owes it to everyone to do one’s best
to clear the thing up. It’s so awkward for all of
us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton gave him what appeared to
be a grateful glance. Then, with more interest than
she had shown for some minutes, she put a direct
question.</p>

<p>“Whom do you really suspect, Mr. Stickney?”</p>

<p>Freddie apparently had been tabulating his
conclusions as he went along, and he was able to answer
her without a pause.</p>

<p>“Three people. I can’t get nearer than that.”</p>

<p>“And they are?” inquired Mrs. Caistor Scorton,
with just a touch of eagerness.</p>

<p>“Miss Cressage, of course,” responded Freddie at
once. “I think her doings need looking into. I’ll
pay special attention to her.”</p>

<p>“Quite true. There’s a good deal that would be
all the better of some explanation. I don’t pretend
to see through it myself. Now, the next person?”</p>

<p>“The American, obviously. If we knew all that
he knows we might know a good deal more than we
do know,” explained Freddie, with the air of a Sibyl
uttering some profound monition.</p>

<p>“Possibly. And the third person?”</p>

<p>“Eric Dangerfield. Curious that I hadn’t thought
of him before, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Very strange,” agreed Mrs. Caistor Scorton.
“You’re usually so quick at conclusions, Mr.
Stickney.”</p>

<p>She rose to her feet with an air of dismissal.</p>

<p>“Well, I mustn’t detain you,” she said. “Be sure
to let me know if you discover anything else that’s
interesting.”</p>

<p>As she moved across the lawn she glanced over her
shoulder and smiled encouragingly; but if Freddie
had been a thought-reader he would hardly have
felt flattered.</p>

<p>“What a malicious little reptile,” she reflected.
“He makes me feel shivery. Luckily he’s not likely
to do any real harm. Nobody will pay any
attention to him.”</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>

<p>Conway Westenhanger had no very high opinion
of his own ability to unravel the Talisman mystery,
and the more he thought over the subject the less
could he see any simple solution. One point,
however, seemed beyond dispute: the method of
elimination, as handled by Freddie Stickney, had been
given a trial and had led to absolutely nothing
whatever. The net result of Freddie’s efforts was
that everybody had been made to feel uncomfortable,
while not a single gleam of light had been thrown
upon the problem. And yet, given the conditions
of the case, the elimination method seemed to
promise results. If the servants were put on one
side, and if no thief had got into the house in the
darkness, then only thirteen persons remained who
had any possible means of access to the Corinthian’s
Room that night. One of them must be responsible
for the vanishing of the Talisman. That seemed
an inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p>But here his train of thought was crossed by
another. He could not quite dismiss from his mind
the impression made upon him by the way in which
old Rollo Dangerfield had taken his loss.</p>

<p>“The thing’s worth at least £50,000,”
Westenhanger reflected. “The Dangerfields may be well
enough off, but a loss on that scale is something
more than a flea-bite. And yet he doesn’t seem
disturbed in the slightest. One could bet that he
really believes the Talisman will turn up again in a
few days. If it isn’t cold confidence, then it’s the
best acting I ever saw. I could almost take my
oath that he meant what he said.”</p>

<p>He turned the matter over and over in his mind
for a time; but although a number of suggestions
offered themselves, none of them seemed
satisfying.</p>

<p>“It may be a case of rank superstition, but I don’t
read him so myself. Who believes in that sort of
stuff nowadays? It can’t be that. Of course, he
side-tracked all the talk about the Dangerfield
Secret. He’s probably half-ashamed of that
business—likely it’s some old ritual about informing the
heir that in 1033 or so the head of the Dangerfields
sold his soul to the Devil. The Dangerfield Secret
has nothing to do with the case anyway.”</p>

<p>But Westenhanger was wrong on that point, as
he was to discover at no distant date. However,
dismissing that line of thought, he sought for other
possible explanations of the mystery.</p>

<p>“The old man may know who took the Talisman,”
he suggested to himself. “If that’s so, then perhaps
he means to put the screw on the culprit quietly,
without saying anything to the rest of us. Most
obviously he doesn’t want a scandal at Friocksheim.
But in that case he must have spotted the wrong
’un immediately; because, first thing in the
morning, he was quite certain that the Talisman would
turn up again—he wasn’t worried in the slightest
degree. If he tracked down the thief between one
a.m. and breakfast-time, it was a lightning bit of
detective work. But if it wasn’t a case of detection,
then the only possible explanation is that he
actually saw the theft committed.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger paused only for a moment on this
idea, however, for its inherent improbability struck
him at once.</p>

<p>“That’s no good. If he’d caught the thief in the
act, he’d simply have threatened to expose him;
got the Talisman back from him, and replaced it in
its cabinet without giving rise to all this trouble.”</p>

<p>Then a new thought occurred to him.</p>

<p>“But suppose old Rollo couldn’t trust the thief
not to have a second try, with better luck the second
shot? That’s a possibility. If I’d been in old
Rollo’s shoes under these conditions I think I’d
have pocketed the Talisman and kept it safe until
that particular guest’s visit was up. Then he
could put it back in the cabinet with a comfortable
mind. That’s a possibility, too, and Wraxall might
fit the case.”</p>

<p>But here again his knowledge would hardly fit the
hypothesis.</p>

<p>“No, that won’t work, either,” he admitted to
himself. “Old Rollo’s a chivalrous old bird. He
knows Miss Cressage is under suspicion now—Freddie’s
sure to have let that leak out. If the old
man knew the identity of the thief he certainly
wouldn’t stand aside and let the girl bear the brunt
of things for a moment, I’m sure. . . . Wraxall
isn’t even a friend of the Dangerfields; he’s the
merest casual caller, so far as they’re concerned.
There’s no reason why they should shield <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>He cudgelled his brain for another alternative
hypothesis.</p>

<p>“Suppose the old man didn’t spot the thief, but
managed somehow to discover where the Talisman
was hidden after it was stolen. He may be keeping
a watch on the hiding-place, waiting for the thief
to give himself away by going after the thing at
last.”</p>

<p>He brooded for a time on the various ideas he had
evolved; but in the end he put them all aside.</p>

<p>“Damn it!” he said, irritably, “if I go on like
this, I’ll end up by being as bad as Freddie. That’s
not the way to go about the business at all. What’s
wanted is new facts, not a lot of futile ideas. One
must begin somewhere. I’ll go and have a look at
the Corinthian’s Room and see if anything suggests
itself when I’m on the actual spot.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger had learnt that no change had been
made in the Corinthian’s Room since the theft.
The cabinet had been untouched, just as the thief
had left it. They had all been asked not to tamper
with anything.</p>

<p>“The Talisman will come back by the way in
which it went,” Old Dangerfield had said, with a
faint mockery in his voice. “Let us leave the door
open for it to get into its case again.”</p>

<p>Without any very strong hope in his mind,
Westenhanger made his way to the Corinthian’s
Room which, to his relief, was untenanted. He
felt a certain shamefacedness in actually embarking
on this attempt at detection, and he was glad that he
could examine the place without betraying his
purpose. As he entered the door, his eye was caught
by the gigantic chess-board set in the floor pattern,
and he examined it curiously.</p>

<p>“These little holes at the corners of the squares
are rum,” he thought, as his eye was caught by one
of them. “I begin to wonder whether Wraxall
wasn’t near the mark when he talked about some
kind of man-trap for protecting the Talisman. But
no, that’s obviously rubbish, because the Talisman’s
gone and yet none of us shows much in the way of
visible damage. Besides, old Rollo declared there
was no man-trap—you could lift the Talisman and
come to no harm. He volunteered that. And if
there’s one thing certain in this business it’s that
Rollo isn’t an aimless liar. That notion has nothing
in it.”</p>

<p>He stepped across the chess-board and halted
before the empty cabinet which had held the
Dangerfield Talisman. It stood on its stone pillar so that
the glass front was breast high, and he examined it
minutely in the hope of detecting something
significant. The central plate-glass slab, through which
he had inspected the armlet three nights before,
was intact. On the velvet floor of the cabinet he
could see the clearly marked ring made by the
long-continued pressure of the bell-cover of tinted glass
which now stood in a fresh position a little to the
right, almost behind the closed door of the cabinet.
The other door stood half-open, and he noticed that
it had no lock but only an ordinary spring-catch.
Idly he tried the strength of the spring, using his nail
to avoid leaving any finger-marks, and he found that
the catch was in good order. The handles of the
doors were simple in pattern, like miniature
corkscrew handles. Conway Westenhanger studied the
glass surfaces with care, but after a time he
abandoned his self-imposed task.</p>

<p>“Not much use bothering about finger-marks
there,” he commented. “There’s no saying how
many of us had our paws on it, that night he showed
us the Talisman. Some of them are bound to be
there, even if the case has been dusted by the
servants. Most likely there’s a set of my own
amongst them. Nobody could be incriminated by
that, certainly. There’s nothing in it.”</p>

<p>He stepped back a pace to look at the cabinet as a
whole, and suddenly a keen expression crossed his
features. He had seen the thing he wanted.</p>

<p>“Well, <em>that</em> limits it down considerably!” he said
with relief. “What a bit of pure luck! And I
believe I’m right, too.”</p>

<p>He thought for a moment or two before deciding
on his next step.</p>

<p>“This isn’t going to be so easy, after all,” he
concluded, with more hesitation in his manner. “I
can’t go running round them, asking that particular
question bluntly, or the thief will be put on his guard
long before it comes to his turn. This affair will
need careful handling—very careful. And I’ll need
to try a blank experiment first with someone who is
absolutely above suspicion. I know how I’d do the
thing, but I’m prejudiced subconsciously, probably.
I’ll need some subject who doesn’t know what I’m
after.”</p>

<p>He ran over in his mind the list of the
house-party.</p>

<p>“Douglas, of course! He’s the man. He offered
to help if I needed him, and he’s able to keep his
tongue quiet.”</p>

<p>Then a fresh thought occurred to him. A picture
of Eileen Cressage’s strained face came up in his
memory and changed his immediate purpose.</p>

<p>“I’ll see her first, and try it,” he decided. “After
all, the main thing is to clear her and get her out
of this affair if possible. Once that’s done, there
will be time enough to think about Douglas.”</p>

<p>It took him longer than he expected to hit upon a
line of procedure that satisfied him. More than
once he was forced to discard an idea which proved
faulty after consideration and think out something
fresh. At last, however, his plans seemed to be
sound so far as he could see. He closed the door
of the Corinthian’s Room and made his way into the
hall. Freddie Stickney was sitting beside the main
entrance, evidently deep in thought.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Freddie!” Westenhanger brutally
interrupted the reflections of the amateur detective.
“Seen Douglas about anywhere?”</p>

<p>“I think he’s been playing tennis. Most likely
he’s still down at the courts.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Seen Cynthia and Miss Cressage since
breakfast?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger was careful to couple Eileen’s name
with Cynthia’s in his demand. He had no desire
to let Freddie know that he was in search of Eileen
in particular.</p>

<p>“Cynthia’s probably down at the tennis courts
with Douglas,” Freddie assured him. “I saw them
go off together in that direction. Miss Cressage
went away by herself some time ago, towards the
shore—over yonder.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger nodded his thanks curtly and
descended the steps leading down into the gardens.
He sauntered along while he was within range of
Freddie’s eyes, but as soon as he got out of sight of
the door, he quickened his steps. Ten minutes
brought him to a spot from which he could see the
nearer coastline, and, looking from point to point,
he at last detected a girl’s figure on a tiny headland
which ran out to form one horn of the bay.</p>

<p>He made his way indirectly towards her, and
before he reached the ridge of the headland he
slackened his pace, so that when he actually came
into her neighbourhood he seemed to have arrived
there by pure chance in the course of an aimless
walk. He wished, above everything, to avoid giving
her the impression that he had deliberately sought
her out; for the test he meant to apply depended
for its success on her being completely off her guard.
He had not the slightest doubt as to the result, but
his scientific caution demanded that he should play
his game with absolute fairness. If the test was to
establish anything whatever, it would have to be
applied without fear or favour.</p>

<p>As he drew nearer he tried to read something from
her attitude. She faced the sea, and from time to
time he saw her glance along the horizon, only to look
down again when her eyes found nothing but the
skyline.</p>

<p>“That girl’s got a bit of personality somewhere,”
Westenhanger reflected, as he advanced. “Every
line of her figure shows some emotion, just as clearly
as if I were looking at her face. But what
particular emotion is it? She looks dejected, but that
isn’t everything. There’s something else there as
well.”</p>

<p>Enlightenment flashed across him.</p>

<p>“That’s the way Robinson Crusoe might have
looked when he was hoping for a sail and yet felt
certain it wasn’t coming that day. It’s hope
deferred that’s wrong with that girl. But what’s she
hoping for?”</p>

<p>By this time he had come quite close to her, and
at the sound of his steps on the turf she turned her
head.</p>

<p>“Not disturbing you, I hope?” he said, casually,
as he came up. “I came up to have a look at the
view for a moment or two. May I sit down?”</p>

<p>She nodded assent, seeming to accept his company
with indifference. He seated himself a couple of
yards away and for some minutes he gazed over the
bay without saying anything.</p>

<p>“May I smoke?”</p>

<p>She gave him permission, and he rose and stepped
across to offer his case. She took a cigarette, but
he seemed to change his mind, closed his case and
put it back in his pocket. Then he re-seated himself
in his old position.</p>

<p>“That’s stupid of me,” he exclaimed, as the girl
looked at her unlighted cigarette. He drew out a
little silver box and tossed it over to her. “Catch.”</p>

<p>He threw it so clumsily, that though she snatched
at it in the air, she missed it, and was forced to reach
over and pick it up.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” Westenhanger apologised, as she struck
a match for herself.</p>

<p>He waited for some minutes before saying
anything further. Eileen Cressage seemed to feel no
desire for talk. She smoked slowly, and from time
to time her eyes followed the tiny blue clouds as they
drifted seaward on the faint airs which came from
the land. Westenhanger was not deceived. She
was still scanning the horizon-line in search of
something. Suddenly he realised what the thing must be.</p>

<p>“I wonder how Mrs. Brent is getting on,” he said,
watching the girl’s face as he spoke. “She hasn’t
made any sign since she left.”</p>

<p>“How could she?”</p>

<p>“Oh, wireless. Most boats have it.”</p>

<p>“I wish the <i>Kestrel</i> had. But she hasn’t.”</p>

<p>Something in the girl’s voice surprised
Westenhanger—an intensity of feeling which seemed quite
uncalled-for by the subject. Of course, Eileen was
watching for the <i>Kestrel’s</i> return. That was why
she had come up to the headland; that was why
she looked out to sea so eagerly. Anyone could put
two and two together to that extent. But why
should she be so eager to get into touch with the
yacht? Obviously she wanted to do so; the
reference to the lack of wireless could mean nothing else.
And the tone of her voice was enough to betray the
intensity of her desire.</p>

<p>Of course the <i>Kestrel</i> meant Mrs. Brent; there
was no one else on board except the crew. But that
meant that the return of Mrs. Brent was the thing
Eileen Cressage was awaiting with such eagerness.
Where did Mrs. Brent come into the affair? The
only thing that mattered now to the girl was to be
extricated from the position she was in. Had she
been shielding Mrs. Brent in something? Had she
given Mrs. Brent some promise of secrecy and was
she now waiting for the <i>Kestrel’s</i> return so that she
might take back her promise and clear herself? It
sounded unlikely. Mrs. Brent could hardly be
mixed up in the Talisman mystery. But if she was
not, why should Eileen be so eager for the coming of
the yacht?</p>

<p>He watched the sea again, avoiding the girl’s face
with his eyes. After a time she finished her
cigarette and threw away the stub.</p>

<p>“Another?” he suggested, drawing out his case.</p>

<p>She refused, and he took a cigarette himself and
felt for his match-box. Eileen had let it slip down
to the ground beside her after using it, and she now
picked it up and tossed it across to him.
Westenhanger deliberately lighted his cigarette, blew out
the match carefully, and pitched it away before
saying anything.</p>

<p>“Nobody suspects you of taking the Talisman,
Miss Cressage,” he said at last.</p>

<p>The girl started as though she had been stung, and
made a gesture as though she wished to stop him
saying anything further. Westenhanger continued
without appearing to notice her action.</p>

<p>“If that was all I had to say, Miss Cressage, I
think I would have left it to your imagination. No
decent person thinks you had anything to do with
that business; and I expect you know that without
my telling you. What I wanted to say was a shade
more interesting.”</p>

<p>He looked out to seaward, so as to let the girl feel
that he was not watching her.</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> you didn’t take it, and I think I’ll be
able to prove that fairly conclusively to any
reasonable person.”</p>

<p>To his surprise she showed very little relief at his
statement. Her voice had no particular ring of
pleasure in it when she replied. It seemed almost
as though she regarded the matter as of slight
importance in comparison with something else that was
in her mind. Westenhanger was frankly puzzled
by her attitude—even a little nettled to find that his
efforts on her behalf led to so little acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you, Mr. Westenhanger. I
know I have some very good friends here at
Friocksheim. But there are some other people here too.
I know perfectly well what some of them think.
Even if I were cleared of the Talisman theft, they’d
go on repeating other things about me. Oh, I know
what they’ve been saying. I’m not a fool, Mr.
Westenhanger. I know quite well what that
miserable little beast Stickney has been hinting about me.”</p>

<p>She raised her eyes again to the sky-line, looking
over the empty sea.</p>

<p>“Oh, I <em>do</em> wish the <i>Kestrel</i> would come!”</p>

<p>For a few moments Westenhanger also scanned
the horizon, giving her time to pull herself together
again. When she broke the silence, it was in another
tone.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Westenhanger. That was
ungrateful of me. You’ve been very kind. Don’t
take that seriously. You know I’ve got very raw
nerves just now, and you mustn’t blame me too
much.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger’s smile reassured her.</p>

<p>“Now I’m all right,” she went on. “I don’t
deserve it; but I wish you’d tell me just what you
meant by what you said just now. How can you
clear me in the Talisman affair? Of course I knew
all along that you never believed I took it. I could
see that in your face—and in Douglas’s too. But
proving it’s a different thing, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger smiled again, in genuine
amusement this time; and his expression helped the girl
in her struggle for the control of her nerves.</p>

<p>“I’m going to play the mystery-man for another
quarter of an hour,” he said, “then I’ll explain the
whole affair to you. We’ll need Douglas’s help also.
But just to tantalise you, I can tell you that I got
absolute certainty on the point since I came up
here half and hour ago. Now, if that excites your
curiosity, let’s gather in Douglas and clear the ground
for my explanation. It’s so simple that you’ll
probably think you saw it yourself, really.”</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and gave a last glance round
the sea-rim; but no smoke showed on the horizon.
Then they made their way down the headland and
back into the Friocksheim grounds. Douglas had
finished his tennis, they found when they reached
the courts; and as Cynthia had gone into the house
to write a letter he was easily persuaded to go with
Westenhanger and Eileen. As they walked through
the gardens, the engineer puzzled Douglas by a
request.</p>

<p>“Have you a thick scarf, Miss Cressage?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face showed that she had no idea of
what lay behind the inquiry.</p>

<p>“Well, would you mind getting it—and a pair of
gloves. And then would you come to the
Corinthian’s Room?”</p>

<p>She nodded without saying anything, and
Westenhanger turned to Douglas.</p>

<p>“Your outfit, my lad, will be a pair of thin gloves,
if you have them. Bring ’em to the Corinthian’s
Room, and don’t keep Miss Cressage waiting. I’m
going there myself direct.”</p>

<p>In a few moments they rejoined him.</p>

<p>“Now, Douglas,” he said, “your business is to
stand in the corridor at present and detain any
possible intruder by the charm of your conversation.
Nobody’s to get into this room for the next five
minutes. You’re a peaceful picket, you
understand?”</p>

<p>Douglas grinned and retired into the corridor.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Cressage,” said Westenhanger,
pushing the door until it was almost closed, “would you
mind putting on your gloves.”</p>

<p>The girl did so and then looked at him with a
puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about, Mr. Westenhanger? I
don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you must bear with it for a minute
or two more and then it will be quite obvious. Do
you mind if I blindfold you with this scarf? I
know it looks like a child’s game; but I really am
serious.”</p>

<p>He wound the scarf round her head and fastened
it gently.</p>

<p>“Can you see?”</p>

<p>“No; you’ve been quite efficient.”</p>

<p>“It’s most important that you shouldn’t see
anything. Quite sure you’re absolutely blindfolded?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“Very good.”</p>

<p>She heard a click like the closing of a pocket-knife,
then Westenhanger’s voice in a low tone near her ear.</p>

<p>“I’ve just shut the door of the cabinet. Now
let me lead you over to it.”</p>

<p>He guided her carefully for a step or two.</p>

<p>“Now,” he continued in the same low tone, “you’re
standing right in front of the centre of the cabinet.
If you lift your hand you can open the door.
Try it.”</p>

<p>Obediently Eileen put out her hand, groped and
caught the handle and, after turning it, opened the
door.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Westenhanger again, “suppose you
try to reach the place where the Talisman was.
Wait! You might knock over the bell, being
blindfolded. Don’t move an inch after I say Stop! . . .
Stop!”</p>

<p>She brought her hand to rest immediately.</p>

<p>“Now, bring your hand back to your side and
then take a step backwards. I’ll see you don’t trip.”</p>

<p>As she stood, after completing the movement, she
heard another slight click.</p>

<p>“That’s all, Miss Cressage. Now I’ll take the
scarf off.”</p>

<p>He did so, and she looked round, slightly dazzled
by the sunlight which streamed into the room.
Nothing seemed to be changed; and she failed to
understand what his manœuvres meant. Then her
eyes ranged over the cabinet and something caught
her attention.</p>

<p>“You’ve been playing some trick on me, Mr.
Westenhanger,” she said, indignantly. “I’m sure
I opened the right-hand door of the cabinet, and
now it’s the left-hand one that’s open!”</p>

<p>Westenhanger, as soon as she began to speak,
had crossed the room swiftly and closed the door
leading into the corridor completely. He turned
back with a vexed expression on his face.</p>

<p>“My fault entirely,” he said. “I ought to have
shut that door. You nearly gave the show away to
Douglas. Didn’t I tell you it was obvious?”</p>

<p>Eileen looked from him to the cabinet and then
back again to his face, which showed a mixture of
triumph and amusement.</p>

<p>“But it isn’t obvious,” she protested. “I don’t
understand what you’re driving at.”</p>

<p>“We’ll repeat the whole performance with Douglas,
and you’ll see the point.”</p>

<p>He went to the door again and summoned the
picket.</p>

<p>“Douglas, come inside. I strongly recommend
to your attention the genuine antique carving on
the back of this door. It’s well worthy of study.
Study it.”</p>

<p>Douglas Fairmile obediently stepped into the room,
faced the door and fixed his eye on the carving.</p>

<p>“I know it by heart, old man,” he asserted. “You
can’t puzzle me with any of your parlour games.”</p>

<p>“Got it well into your mind? All right. Miss
Cressage will now blindfold you.”</p>

<p>The girl, still more puzzled by this procedure, put
the scarf over Douglas’s eyes and fastened it in
position.</p>

<p>“Blind as a bat, Douglas?” demanded
Westenhanger. His tone changed. “I’m serious. You
can’t see anything?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger took out his pen-knife and opened
it silently. He drew Eileen’s attention to it with a
glance.</p>

<p>“Oh, half a jiff,” he exclaimed, as if he suddenly
remembered something. “One of the cabinet doors
is open. I’ll shut it.” He shut his pen-knife with a
click; but to Eileen’s surprise he made no attempt
to close the open door of the cabinet.</p>

<p>“Now, Douglas, this way. I’ll lead you.”</p>

<p>Again he gave the same series of orders as he had
given to her. She saw Douglas put out his right
hand, grope for the handle of the right-hand door,
open it, and then inserting his arm into the case,
reach to the left towards the place where the
Talisman used to lie.</p>

<p>“Stop! . . . Now come out again, gently. Don’t
upset the glass bell.”</p>

<p>Douglas withdrew his arm cautiously.</p>

<p>“One pace to the rear, and stand fast.”</p>

<p>Douglas stepped back obediently. Westenhanger
went up to the cabinet.</p>

<p>“I’m shutting the door. Hear the click?”</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word, closing the door
which Douglas had opened. Then he turned round
to Eileen.</p>

<p>“<em>Now</em> do you see, Miss Cressage? That’ll do,
Douglas. You can take off your turban. It doesn’t
suit you.”</p>

<p>Douglas disentangled himself from the scarf,
blinked for a moment or two, and then looked at
the cabinet.</p>

<p>“What’s your little game?” he demanded. “The
left-hand door’s open now. It was the right-hand
one that I opened.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Westenhanger. “The left-hand
door’s been open all the time—<em>just as the thief left it</em>.
Neither of you touched it. That’s why I blindfolded
you both. I wanted you to think both doors were
shut; and I didn’t want to close that left-hand door.
Much better to leave things exactly as they are.
The Dangerfields may want to call in the police
after all, you know; and we mustn’t destroy any
possible clues. Hence the gloves I asked you to
put on—you’ve left no fingermarks.”</p>

<p>Eileen broke in with a trace of excitement in her
voice.</p>

<p>“Now I <em>do</em> see. You wanted to test which hand
I used when I opened the cabinet. Both Douglas
and I are right-handed. The thief was left-handed
because he opened the other door—not the one we
opened. Is that it?”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” admitted Westenhanger. “I told you
it was obvious. And of course all that by-play was
just meant to keep your mind off the crucial action,
so that you’d do it perfectly naturally, without
giving it a thought. See it, Douglas? Don’t forget
the pattern on the back of the door; it’s most
important, you know!”</p>

<p>“You had me there, I’ll admit,” confessed
Douglas. “You wandered me completely, so that
I hadn’t a notion what you were after. And so the
thief’s left-handed, is he?”</p>

<p>“Looks like it, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Eileen stepped over to the cabinet and examined
it for a moment or two.</p>

<p>“How, exactly, did you come to think of it, Mr.
Westenhanger? I suppose it was the left-hand door
that gave you the key?”</p>

<p>“There’s some confirmatory evidence,”
Westenhanger explained. “Will you stand in front of the
case, Miss Cressage? Now notice that you’ve the
choice between the two doors if you wanted to get
at the Talisman. You’re right-handed, so you
choose the right-hand door, naturally. Besides, it’s
always easier to turn a handle clockwise than
counter-clockwise; and that favours the right-hand again,
subconsciously. To open the cabinet you turn the
right-hand handle as you turn a corkscrew, which
is easier than turning the left-hand handle
counter-clockwise.”</p>

<p>Eileen put out both hands and imitated the motion
of opening the doors.</p>

<p>“That’s true enough,” she said. “I remember
that sometimes a door handle gives one trouble if
it works in the opposite direction from the usual
way.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger continued his explanation.</p>

<p>“Now look at where the bell has been placed.
That’s the really important point. The thief might
have been a right-handed man and used his right
hand to take the Talisman; then, after he had got
it, he might have closed the door he had used and
opened the left-hand one. But the bell gives him
away.”</p>

<p>Douglas examined the case closely.</p>

<p>“The bell’s slightly to the right of its old position.
Is that what you mean?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger nodded.</p>

<p>“That’s it. A right-handed man goes in at the
right-hand door, just as you both did. Then he
crooks his elbow towards his chest to get his hand
over to the Talisman. That brings his hand to the
centre of the case. It’s a narrow case, you notice.
Not much room to manœuvre in it.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Eileen. “He’d pick up the bell;
and he’d have to put it down again—clear of the
Talisman—in order to pick up the jewel. If he put
it down on the right-hand side of the case, it would
be in the way of his arm in getting out again, so he’d
set it down <em>beyond</em> the Talisman, towards the left of
the case. Then he’d pick up the Talisman and take
his hand and arm out of the case. Is that it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” confirmed Westenhanger. “That’s what
a right-handed man would do. And since the bell’s
been set down towards the right hand of the cabinet,
it’s obvious that there’s been a left-hander at work,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That seems right,” Eileen admitted. “It’s very
clever of you to have noticed it.”</p>

<p>“You noticed it yourself. It just happened that
I was lucky enough to spot the thing almost at once.”</p>

<p>Eileen reflected for a moment, then she addressed
Westenhanger directly.</p>

<p>“There’s just one other thing I don’t quite
understand. Out on the headland, you said you’d made
certain about the matter after you met me there.
That means you weren’t quite sure before. What
did you mean by that?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s obvious, too. Don’t you see it now?”</p>

<p>The girl went over in her memory the talk which
she had had with him half an hour previously; but
quite evidently it suggested nothing to her mind as
a solution.</p>

<p>“No,” she admitted at last, “I can’t think of
anything.”</p>

<p>“It’s simple enough. Think of the things I did;
don’t bother about anything I said to you.”</p>

<p>After a moment Eileen recalled something.</p>

<p>“You offered me a cigarette.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I held the case so that you could reach it
with either hand; but you used your right hand to
pick out the cigarette.”</p>

<p>“Was that all?” She put on a judicial expression.
“That doesn’t seem much to go on in a thing like
this—does it, Douglas?”</p>

<p>“Look at him grinning,” said Douglas, in sham
disgust. “He’s laughing at us. He’s got more up
his sleeve, of course.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger admitted it with a nod.</p>

<p>“Of course I have. What happened next, Miss
Cressage?”</p>

<p>“I smoked for a while.”</p>

<p>“Do you usually smoke unlighted cigarettes?”</p>

<p>Eileen laughed at her omission.</p>

<p>“No, of course not. I remember now. You gave
me your match-box.”</p>

<p>“Hardly correct in detail. I was rude enough to
pitch my match-box across to you, so that you could
catch it with either hand. What I wanted to see
was which hand you would use. You made a snatch
at it—with your right hand.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t imagine I was being watched so closely
as all that, Mr. Westenhanger. Is that all, now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. There’s more to come. You finished
your cigarette and threw away the stub. You tried
to fling it over the cliff-edge on your right side, if
you remember.”</p>

<p>“I think so. One does these things without
thinking about them.”</p>

<p>“That’s just why I attached importance to them
in this case. Now think. It was a fairly long
distance to throw a cigarette, wasn’t it. You just
failed to send yours over the edge. So you had to
pitch it to the best of your ability. If you’d been
left-handed you’d have used your left hand, swinging
it across your body. What you actually did was to
use your right hand in an awkward attitude.
Evidently your right hand, even used awkwardly, was
better than your left used in a natural gesture.
Obvious conclusion—you were right-handed.”</p>

<p>“That was rather neat, wasn’t it, Douglas?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Conway always had the name of a smart
lad, even among the great brains like myself. Don’t
let’s interrupt him. I can see he’s still bursting
with news.”</p>

<p>“How do you strike a match on a box, Douglas?”
demanded Westenhanger, suddenly.</p>

<p>“How should I know? This way, of course.”</p>

<p>Douglas fished a match-box from his pocket, took
out a vesta and struck it.</p>

<p>“That’s what you did, Miss Cressage. You held
the match in your right hand and the box in your
left, just as Douglas is holding them now. A
left-hander reverses the positions and strikes the match
with his left hand. I remember noticing that once.”</p>

<p>“Anything more, Mr. Westenhanger?”</p>

<p>“Just one thing. After a while, I took out a
cigarette myself and you had to throw my
match-box across to me. You used your right hand again.
That made five things, in any one of which even
partial left-handedness might have come out. What
settled it, to my mind, was the snatch at the
match-box when I tossed it over to you. That’s an almost
instinctive movement, when you’ve no time to
think. One uses the hand that’s had most practice,
provided one has a free choice between the two
hands; and I was careful to pitch the box so that
you might have used either hand for it.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a good actor, Mr. Westenhanger.
I never suspected anything at all; and the whole
time you must have been watching me like a cat
watching a mouse.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have been much good if you had
suspected,” said Westenhanger. He turned to
Douglas. “Now, Douglas, does that evidence seem
enough to prove that Miss Cressage had no hand in
the Talisman’s disappearance? I promised her I
could do that. It’s for you to say.”</p>

<p>Douglas Fairmile had no doubts.</p>

<p>“Of course it does. I may not be an impartial
judge, of course; for I never believed for a moment
that Eileen had the least connection with the
Talisman affair. But that evidence would convince most
people. Smart of you to spot these things, Conway.”</p>

<p>Conway Westenhanger glanced from one to the
other.</p>

<p>“It’s for Miss Cressage to say what we ought to
do next,” he pointed out to them. “My main
reason for going into the thing at all was simply
to clear her of suspicion.”</p>

<p>Eileen gave him a grateful glance and seemed
inclined to say something. Then quite evidently
she changed her mind and chose a fresh subject.</p>

<p>“What do you think, Douglas?”</p>

<p>“Never suffered from doubts in my life. Seems
to me the first thing is to put a stop to any more
chatter with your name in it, Eileen. Call another
general meeting. Let Conway make a few remarks.
That would finish it.”</p>

<p>Eileen looked from one to the other doubtfully.
She reflected for a moment or two, while Douglas
and Westenhanger waited for her to speak. At last
she gave them her view.</p>

<p>“No, you’re wrong, Douglas. That wouldn’t
finish it. It would simply turn it into something
worse. Both Mrs. Caistor Scorton and that little
creature Stickney were accurate enough in what
they said last night. I was out of my room, just as
they made out. If I wasn’t stealing the Talisman,
then they’d have their own ideas about where I was
during that time. Mr. Westenhanger knows what
I mean; and so do you, Douglas. And I can’t clear
myself. I really can’t.”</p>

<p>She deliberately caught the eye of each man in turn
and held it long enough to show that she was not
avoiding them; then she looked down, as if
thinking carefully.</p>

<p>“You certainly mustn’t say anything about this,
just now. It wouldn’t do me any good. And there’s
a better reason. Our one chance of catching this
thief is to find the left-handed man amongst the
people here. If you bring out this evidence, he’ll
be on his guard at once and cover up his
left-handedness somehow. He could cut his right hand badly,
or something like that.”</p>

<p>“I knew that,” admitted Westenhanger, “but
the main thing still seems to me to get you cleared.
Don’t you want to be?”</p>

<p>Eileen studied his face in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you something,” she said, at last.
“When you came down this morning and began to
talk, I thought you were just trying to be
sympathetic; but I didn’t take it at face value. I
believed you were only trying to cheer me up, and that
your talk about proving things wasn’t meant to be
taken seriously. Now I know you really did mean
what you said. What’s more, I’ve learned that
somebody did more than just sympathise. You
didn’t stop there, Mr. Westenhanger: you did
something practical to clear me of suspicion.”</p>

<p>“I happened to be lucky, first shot—that’s all.”</p>

<p>She waved that aside and went on:</p>

<p>“You really <em>did</em> something, no matter how you
choose to describe it; you didn’t simply stand round,
pitying me. Do you know, that’s made things
ever so much easier for me, now that I know about
it. I can’t explain why; it’s just a feeling. I don’t
feel absolutely isolated now, as I did this morning.
Don’t think I’m ungrateful to you and Cynthia,
Douglas, or to Nina either. You were all as kind as
you could be. But somehow nobody seemed to be
doing anything to help; and I was feeling the strain
of it all, horribly. Now it seems all right again,
somehow.”</p>

<p>She stopped for a moment, then added
doubtfully:</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose I’ve made it clear; but it is so.
I feel as if a weight were off my mind. I don’t
care how long it is before the <i>Kestrel</i> comes back.”</p>

<p>“What’s the <i>Kestrel</i> got to do with it?” asked
Douglas.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you,” she said, in a lighter tone. “It’s
my turn to play the mystery-man, Mr.
Westenhanger. But everything will be all right when the
<i>Kestrel</i> drops anchor in the bay. I feel sure of
that.”</p>

<p>“Are you talking about the Talisman?” demanded
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“No! What’s the <i>Kestrel</i> got to do with the
Talisman?” Eileen asked in surprise. “I only meant
my own affairs. I can’t tell you anything about the
Talisman. I know nothing about it.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger accepted her statement without
comment.</p>

<p>“Then I take it that you think we ought to use
this affair”—he indicated the cabinet—“to track
down the fellow who stole the Talisman? Things
are to be left as they are, so far as you’re concerned?
You don’t want us to say anything to the rest of
them?”</p>

<p>“No, certainly not.” There was no hesitation in
her tone. “You’ve got a trump card with this thing,
Mr. Westenhanger. You know that well enough.
And the thief must be found. One has to agree
even with Mr. Stickney at times. He’s quite right.
We <em>are</em> all under suspicion until this thing is cleared
up; and I think it ought to be cleared up. I know
just exactly how it feels to be under suspicion.
You must see it through to the end and catch the
thief. I’m sure you can—you’re quite clever enough
for that—and it’s the only way to clear the rest of
us completely. I wouldn’t hear of it being used
and wasted merely to clear me personally and leave
all the rest in the lurch. We’ve got other people
to think of as well.”</p>

<p>“Very sporting of you, Eileen,” said Douglas.
“I think you’re right. But if you change your mind,
of course you’ll let us know?”</p>

<p>“I’m really all right again, thanks. I shan’t worry
a bit now. Things are quite different—and I can
wait for the <i>Kestrel</i>.”</p>

<h2>Chapter IX</h2>

<p>For almost a week, Friocksheim had been under
strain. First had come the sultry spell, days of
oppressive heat which set sensitive nerves on edge
and brought a certain lassitude to even the most
active of the guests. The storm, though it cleared
the physical atmosphere, had coincided with the
creation of a fresh tension. A cloud of suspicion,
heavier than the cumulus in the sky, had settled
down upon the house; and as the days passed
without any sign of its dispersion, its influence showed
more and more clearly among the house-party.
Even Douglas Fairmile’s normal high spirits were
unable to resist it entirely.</p>

<p>“Something will have to be done about this
business, Conway,” he complained, as they sat smoking
in the Corinthian’s Room in the afternoon. “It’s
gone on for three days now, and everyone’s feeling
it more or less. We’re all getting off our feed,
metaphorically of course.”</p>

<p>Conway Westenhanger nodded without taking his
eyes from the tapestry on the wall. He seemed to be
studying it closely; but in reality Diana’s hunting
hardly impinged on his attention. Like Douglas, he
was feeling the strain, although personally he was
free from any suspicion.</p>

<p>“Unrestful atmosphere, right enough,” he
commented, shortly.</p>

<p>Douglas made a gesture of impotent irritation.</p>

<p>“Everything’s at sixes and sevens,” he went on.
“Even old Rollo—decent bird—is getting too much
for me. If the talk drifts round towards the root
of the trouble, he just smiles that far-away smile
of his—as if he was thinking about something else
entirely—and one almost expects him to tell us again
that it’s all right, that the damned thing will turn
up again in due course, and that we needn’t worry
over it. Politeness carried to that pitch is
enervating, Conway. That’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“I feel the same myself. But somehow, he’s
almost beginning to make me believe he really means
it. A kind of hypnotic suggestion, I suppose. It’s
impressive, whether you like it or not, to see a man
take a loss like that so quietly. I couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. But he’ll have the lot of us in the jumps
if this goes on. I’m not a suspicious oaf like Freddie,
but it irks me all the same. It’s not so much that
there’s a thief among us that bothers me. We’ve
mixed with all these people before—bar Wraxall.
What really puts my nerves on edge is that I don’t
know <em>which</em> of ’em’s the thief, I want to see the rest
of us cleared.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger’s eye travelled incuriously over the
group of Diana’s nymphs and passed on to the
stag at the other side of the tapestry; but it was
evidently merely a mechanical movement. His
thoughts absorbed the whole of his attention.
Before he made any reply to Douglas the door opened
and Helga Dangerfield came into the room. She
nodded to them as she passed, and went into the
library.</p>

<p>“Where’s Wraxall to-day?” asked Westenhanger,
merely to avoid leaving an impression on the girl
that they had stopped talking on her account.</p>

<p>“Digging up megatheriums or flint arrows
somewhere in the neighbourhood,” said Douglas, taking
the hint. “Or else he’s chaffering for the oldest
nutmeg-grater in Frogsholme. He seems really
keen on that sort of stuff.”</p>

<p>Helga Dangerfield came through the library door
with a book in her hand.</p>

<p>“You like this room?” she asked, pausing for a
moment as she passed. “So do I. It used to be
my playroom when I was getting beyond the
crawling stage.”</p>

<p>“Nice floor for building castles on,” Westenhanger
suggested, with a glance across the smooth marble
pavement. “You must have had rather a jolly
time. Plenty of room.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I wish I had it all over again.” She
smiled at her own idea, than added: “I must hurry
off; Nina and Cynthia are waiting for me.”</p>

<p>As soon as she had left the room Douglas returned
to the point at which the conversation had been
interrupted.</p>

<p>“Can’t you think of anything, Conway? I admit
I’m not the star performer in the thinking orchestra.
It’s up to you to play a solo while I do the grunts
of approval down in the bass.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger shook his head.</p>

<p>“Eliminate and eliminate, that’s the only way.
And the only thing we have to eliminate with is this
left-handed affair. It’s none so easy, Douglas.
The real bother rises out of the fact that most
left-handed people are partly ambidextrous.”</p>

<p>“I get your meaning up to the word ‘fact’,” said
Douglas, apologetically, “but it seems to slip a cog
after that somehow. What about words of one
syllable? I seem to remember seeing special clubs
for left-handed golfers. Not much ambidexterity
about that, surely?”</p>

<p>“That’s just the point,” explained Westenhanger.
“I’ve been thinking about one or two left-handed
people I know, and in most things you wouldn’t
spot that they were left-handed at all. If it’s a
one-handed job they’re doing, they may use their
right hand oftener than their left. It’s only in
two-handed things, like golf, or cricket, or billiards, or
cutting hay with a scythe, that they give themselves
away completely. It’s the arm-motion rather than
the hand that seems to come in. This Talisman
affair is a case in point. The thief was using his
whole arm to get inside the case.”</p>

<p>“That’s probably so,” conceded Douglas,
reluctantly. “It isn’t so easy as I thought.”</p>

<p>Before Westenhanger could elaborate his views,
Eileen Cressage came hurriedly into the room. Her
face was flushed with excitement; her eyes were
bright; and her whole carriage showed that she had
thrown off her load of difficulties at last.
Westenhanger had never seen her looking so care-free.</p>

<p>“The <i>Kestrel’s</i> back at last!” she announced
breathlessly. “She’s making for the bay. I saw her
from the headland, and hurried back to the house to
tell you; that’s why I’m out of breath. I wanted
you to hear the news at once, because it’s all right
now. I’m sure Mrs. Brent will clear everything up
when she comes ashore.”</p>

<p>“That’s the best of news. I am glad, Eileen,”
said Douglas, before Westenhanger could say
anything. “You’ve stuck it out like a good ’un, but it’s
about time it stopped.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger added nothing to Douglas’s words.
His expression spoke for him better than anything
he could have said.</p>

<p>“I can’t wait here,” Eileen explained rapidly.
“I must get down to the beach and get on board as
soon as the yacht comes in. I began to think she’d
never come back. These three days have been like
centuries for slowness.”</p>

<p>“We’ll put you on board,” said Westenhanger.
“Come along, Douglas.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. But really I’d rather go by myself, if
you’ll put the boat into the water for me.”</p>

<p>They walked down to the boat-house, got out
one of the boats and brought it round to the tiny
jetty for her. She stepped lightly aboard, waved her
thanks, and pulled with easy strokes to the <i>Kestrel</i>,
which had just let go her anchor. The two men
watched her get safely on board the yacht and then
turned back towards the house.</p>

<p>“I suppose we’ll hear all about it to-night or
to-morrow,” hazarded Douglas, as they left the jetty.
“You seem a bit relieved, Conway; and I feel rather
that way myself. It’s been a stiffish three days for
a girl, thanks to Master Freddie.”</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> relieved,” Westenhanger acknowledged.
“I’ve had her troubles very much on my mind,
and I’m only too glad to see light ahead. But you
needn’t expect to learn much about the Talisman
business, Douglas; she never had anything to do
with that, you know.”</p>

<p>“At least one part of this infernal mix-up will be
straightened out, though, and that’s always
something.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger made a gesture of assent.</p>

<p>“One never knows what may come out, once
people start talking,” he said, hopefully. “It’s
quite on the cards we may hit on a new idea, after
we’ve heard Mrs. Brent. She’s the missing witness,
the only person who hasn’t had a chance to tell her
story of what happened that night.”</p>

<p>“Who’s that coming up in the car, I wonder,”
said Douglas.</p>

<p>Westenhanger looked across the lawn and saw a
motor with a single passenger at the front door of
the house.</p>

<p>“Seems to be Eric Dangerfield.”</p>

<p>“Something wrong with him, then,” Douglas
commented. “Look at him hobbling up the steps with
a stick. Seems as if he’d lamed himself a bit.”</p>

<p>Eric Dangerfield’s figure laboriously ascended the
steps and disappeared into the house.</p>

<p>“Sprained ankle, or something like that,” was
Westenhanger’s verdict. “Well, Douglas, we’ll just
have to be patient. There’ll be no ’orrible
revelations for an hour or two at least.”</p>

<p>His guess was quite accurate. Eileen and Mrs.
Brent came ashore from the yacht only in time to
dress, and neither of them appeared until the
remainder of the party had assembled. Eric
Dangerfield limped into the dining-room, still using his stick.</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” he explained in answer to a
question. “I twisted my ankle rather badly and had
to rest it. That’s why I didn’t get back here
sooner.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent took very little part in the
conversation at the dinner-table, but when the servants had
left the room after serving coffee, she glanced round
to secure attention and then addressed the company
in general.</p>

<p>“I understand,” she said, with a certain sub-acid
tone in her voice, “that during my absence, Mr.
Stickney has been organising a symposium of sorts.
It seems a pity not to give my contribution to the
common stock, even if it is slightly belated.
Suppose we all go into the drawing-room after dinner for
a few moments. I shan’t detain you long.”</p>

<p>It was impossible to learn from Rollo Dangerfield’s
face whether or not he understood her reference.
Much to his regret, he explained, neither he nor his
wife could be there. They had a meeting in the
village that evening which in courtesy they must
attend.</p>

<p>“I quite understand, Rollo,” Mrs. Brent hastened
to reassure him. “You won’t miss much here, and
in any case I can explain the whole thing to you
to-morrow. It’s of no consequence.”</p>

<p>She made no further reference to the matter until
the whole party, with the exception of their host and
hostess, had gathered in the drawing-room.
Choosing her favourite chair, she made a sign to Eileen to
sit down beside her, and then waited until the others
had grouped themselves.</p>

<p>“It appears,” she began, frowning in Freddie
Stickney’s direction. “It appears that privacy has
gone out of fashion since I went away. That’s a
new phase for Friocksheim, and I don’t feel I’m
much to blame for not anticipating it. Certainly, I
didn’t foresee such a state of affairs, and to that
extent I’m responsible for some events which ought
never to have occurred.”</p>

<p>She stared at Freddie as though he were some
curious animal which she was inspecting for the first
time.</p>

<p>“It seems,” she went on acidly, “that no one can
have any private affairs now, so I think the best
thing is to have a complete clearing-up of some
misunderstandings—is that the right word, Mr.
Stickney?—which have got abroad. I don’t wish to
leave any ground for such things in future. Miss
Cressage agrees with me.”</p>

<p>She turned to the girl.</p>

<p>“Tell them the whole affair from start to finish,
Eileen.”</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage looked up, but paused for a
moment or two before saying anything.
Westenhanger could see that she hated the business, but was
determined to go through with it.</p>

<p>“Some of you know,” she began, “that the other
night I lost a lot of money at bridge. I didn’t
realise during the game how big a loss it was. Very
foolish of me, I admit.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent interrupted her sharply.</p>

<p>“I think the facts will be quite sufficient,
Eileen. I shouldn’t make any comments, if I were
you.”</p>

<p>Eileen accepted the correction, understanding the
underlying motive.</p>

<p>“I was taken aback,” she went on, “when I heard
how much I owed Mrs. Caistor Scorton. I don’t
wish to keep anything back now. It was far more
than I could pay in any reasonable time. I lost
my head, I’m afraid; I wanted at any cost to avoid
a public explanation. So when a cheque was
suggested, I filled one in and handed it over, intending
to explain to Mrs. Caistor Scorton how matters stood,
as soon as I could get her by herself.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger let his eyes wander to Mrs. Caistor
Scorton’s face, but it was absolutely expressionless.</p>

<p>“I felt that was the best thing to do,” Eileen
continued. “It avoided public explanations and
unpleasantness for everyone, and it really made things
no worse.”</p>

<p>She paused, and Mrs. Brent took up the story, as
though their parts had been pre-arranged between
them.</p>

<p>“I seldom interfere in other people’s affairs. I
was brought up to believe that one shouldn’t be a
busybody. But some things seem to me outside
the rules of the game, and then an outsider can take
a hand. I noticed a thing that evening which seemed
to me outside the rules. Taking advantage of a girl
in a tight corner is . . . well, I needn’t comment
on it.”</p>

<p>She darted a contemptuous glance at Morchard,
without taking any pains to disguise it.</p>

<p>“That was what happened that evening.
Naturally, I stepped in.”</p>

<p>Morchard’s face showed that he had not known
this before. He made no comment, and Mrs. Brent
continued.</p>

<p>“I asked Eileen to come to my room after
everyone had gone to bed. I wanted to have a good talk
with her; strike while the iron was hot, you see, and
get a promise out of her that she wouldn’t gamble in
that way again. If I’d waited till next morning
I wouldn’t have been able to make such a strong
impression.”</p>

<p>She glanced towards Freddie Stickney again.</p>

<p>“I asked her to come to my room without letting
anyone know she was coming, because things like
that are better done without the chance of any
other party poking his nose into the affair. It
seemed to me quite a private matter, with which no
one else had any concern. Curiously enough, Mr.
Stickney, my views on that point are still
unchanged.”</p>

<p>Freddie’s beady eyes were fixed on the carpet.
He refused to be drawn. At a gesture from Mrs.
Brent, Eileen continued the narrative.</p>

<p>“I waited until I thought everyone was out of the
way. Then I took my bedroom candle, slipped on
my dressing-gown, and made my way to Mrs. Brent’s
room. That was where I was going when Mrs.
Caistor Scorton saw me.”</p>

<p>The girl had got over the worst of her story; she
reached a point where no blame could attach to her,
and her voice showed the difference. At last she
was able to shake herself free from suspicions.
Westenhanger noticed that she did not even look in
Freddie’s direction. He had ceased to be of any
importance.</p>

<p>“I went down the staircase and along the
corridor to Mrs. Brent’s room. She had been sitting up
waiting for me. I’d like to tell you how kind . . .”</p>

<p>“No comments, please, Eileen,” interjected Mrs.
Brent again. “Let us have the facts.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes met Mrs. Brent’s, resisted for a
moment, and then dropped.</p>

<p>“Very well,” she assented. “It’s for you to say.
They’ll know how I feel without my putting it into
words. I’ll go on. Mrs. Brent told me she would
pay my debt. She gave me some advice. And she
made me promise two things. The first was that I
wouldn’t play bridge again for stakes higher than I
could afford. I promised that. I’d had my lesson.
The second promise was that I wouldn’t mention
to anyone anything that had happened that night.
I promised that, too. It seemed little enough to
promise, after her kindness. She laid a good deal of
stress on it. She said she hated to have anything
of the kind known.”</p>

<p>“I do,” confirmed Mrs. Brent. “I’ve no desire
to publish things of that sort. It’s a private affair.
Of course, I’d no idea then that privacy was a back
number. I’ve learned.”</p>

<p>Eileen took up her narrative again.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brent hadn’t £200 in notes with her. She
gave me a cheque and told me to go up to London
first thing in the morning and pay it into my account,
so as to meet the cheque I had given Mrs. Scorton,
in case it was paid in immediately. Meanwhile,
the thunderstorm began.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent interposed once more.</p>

<p>“I found the storm was getting rather too much
for my nerves after the first peal or two. Having
someone in the room with me helped to steady things
a little; so I asked Miss Cressage to stay with me
until the thunder passed off. She waited with me
till some time in the small hours. Then I let her go;
for she had to get some sleep, and she had to be up
in order to catch the first train.”</p>

<p>She broke off and invited Eileen to continue.</p>

<p>“I left Mrs. Brent’s room and went back to my
own. Just as I got out of Mrs. Brent’s room, Helga
passed me . . .”</p>

<p>Helga Dangerfield’s face showed complete
amazement.</p>

<p>“You saw me?” she demanded. “You must
have made a mistake. It was someone else, surely.
Why, I fell asleep at the tail-end of the storm and
didn’t wake up again till morning.”</p>

<p>Eileen looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“You were going towards the Corinthian’s Room,
Helga. I thought perhaps you were looking for a
book to read, if the storm had kept you awake.
You were past before you noticed me, I thought;
and I was quite glad you hadn’t seen me, since Mrs.
Brent didn’t want anyone to know I’d been down
to see her. You had your blue dressing-gown on.
Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p>Helga Dangerfield shook her head definitely.</p>

<p>“You must have been dreaming, Eileen.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter,” said Eileen, “I’ll go
on with the story. I went up to my room, blew out
my candle, switched on my light, and crept into bed.
I didn’t sleep for quite a long time. I was rather
shaken up, you know, between the storm and the
things that had happened. But I dropped off at
last, and just wakened in time to catch the first
train.”</p>

<p>She looked round the circle till her eye fell on
Eric.</p>

<p>“You remember we went up to town together?”</p>

<p>Eric nodded, but said nothing. Eileen took up
the thread again.</p>

<p>“In town, I went straight to my bank and paid in
Mrs. Brent’s cheque. After that I did some
shopping. Then I suddenly remembered something. I
never wear jewellery, but I have some things. It
struck me that I might raise something on them and
so be able to repay Mrs. Brent part of her cheque at
once. It would be a kind of relief to my mind.
She’d know I was taking things seriously. So I went
back to my bank, where I kept them; took them
out; went to Starbecks with them. I’ve dealt with
Starbecks for years. They know me quite well,
and they made no difficulty about it. I didn’t get
enough to repay Mrs. Brent entirely, but I felt it
was always something done. As I was coming out
of Starbecks’ door I met Mr. Westenhanger, and we
had just time to get to the station and catch the
train.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Brent made a gesture to stop the girl at this
point.</p>

<p>“I think that covers the whole question,” she
said. “Now I’ve just a word or two to say. If I
had imagined what was going to happen, of course
I’d never have asked Miss Cressage to give me that
promise. But I hardly suppose that any sane
person could have foreseen what was coming. It passes
all reasonable bounds. I’ve nothing to say about
Miss Cressage’s views on the matter. Apparently
she believed in keeping private affairs confidential
even under very great strain. She’d given her
promise, and she kept it.”</p>

<p>“What I felt,” explained Eileen, “was that I’d
given you two promises together. If I broke one
of them straight away, what reliance could you have
placed on my word in the second affair? I had
to keep both. And, of course, I had only to wait
for you to come back. Then you’d let me off my
promise, and I could explain everything. It only
meant waiting, I thought. But I hadn’t quite
counted on the construction that would be put on
things.”</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed indignantly as she turned to
Freddie Stickney.</p>

<p>“I haven’t enjoyed giving these explanations.
Probably most of you haven’t enjoyed listening to
them; but I’m sure you’ll understand why you had
to hear them.”</p>

<p>There was an almost inaudible murmur of
sympathetic assent from most of the circle. As it died
down, Mrs. Brent closed the incident in a phrase
or two.</p>

<p>“That’s all. Miss Cressage had one serious fault,
apparently. She was over-straight. I shouldn’t
have blamed her in the slightest if she’d told the
whole story when she was asked. She preferred to
keep the very letter of her promise. I don’t envy
some people their feelings just now. But perhaps
they haven’t any. Toads and so forth are said to
be very insensitive creatures, and the reptiles
generally feel little discomfort. So I am told.”</p>

<p>She took Eileen’s arm gently, and they left the
room together. Undoubtedly, as a creator of
discomfort, Mrs. Brent ran Freddie close.
Westenhanger caught Douglas’s eye, and they followed
Mrs. Brent.</p>

<p>“Let’s try the garden?” suggested Douglas.
“Air in there seems a bit sultry for my taste. That
last whang of Mrs. Brent’s wasn’t perhaps tactful;
but it was nothing to what she might have said if
she’d really let herself go. I’ve never seen her even
peeved before; and to-night she was boiling
underneath the surface. Even the trained observer,
Freddie, can hardly have failed to notice the weather
signs.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we’ll be rid of some of them by
the first train to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“No we shan’t! Nobody can leave Friocksheim
till this Talisman business is cleared up. Your ways
are not ours, Conway. All the rest of us are still
under suspicion and we’ve got to hang on until the
‘All Clear’ signal goes. Pleasant prospect, isn’t it?
Well, we needn’t talk to ’em more than’s needful.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger looked gloomy.</p>

<p>“There’s only one way out of it, then. We’ve
got to find the thief, if we can, and as quick as we
can.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, but easier said than done.”
Douglas’s voice did not sound very hopeful.
“Another canter in the Elimination Stakes to begin
with?”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll be rigid this time. To start
with, we can put aside as completely cleared:
ourselves, Mr. and Mrs. Dangerfield, Mrs. Brent, Nina,
Cynthia, and Eileen Cressage. Do you O.K. that?”</p>

<p>Douglas acquiesced with a nod.</p>

<p>“No doubt in these cases. I’m going on character
as much as alibis and so forth. Let’s sit down.”</p>

<p>They found a garden seat which was dry and
seated themselves.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Scorton? No motive that I can see. I
think she drops out also.”</p>

<p>“Agreed.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s Morchard.” An angry tone came
into Westenhanger’s voice. “He’s out of it too.
You see why? Well, naturally he was the man
Mrs. Brent was getting at. Didn’t you see he
offered to give Eileen the money if she’d come to his
room? He’d be waiting there for her, not roaming
about the house picking up the Talisman.
Obvious, I think. Unless . . . Could he have taken it
and meant to throw suspicion on her? No, he
wouldn’t know she had been out of her room at all
that night. No, that’s wrong. We can leave
Morchard out of it.”</p>

<p>Douglas kicked angrily at the ground.</p>

<p>“The infernal thing is that one can do nothing
to Morchard. The least row would lead to the
devil of a scandal, and Eileen would suffer. It’s
Freddie’s case over again, only fifty times worse.
Our hands are tied.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Westenhanger, shortly. “Let’s
go on.”</p>

<p>Quite evidently he disliked the whole subject.</p>

<p>“That leaves still in the net,” he continued,
“Wraxall for one. I’m prejudiced in favour of
Wraxall; but if he’d planned that theft beforehand,
he’d have fixed up some very neat, circumstantial
story to account for all his night’s doings, you may
be sure. And he undoubtedly had the most
complete tale of the lot. I’m morally sure he didn’t
do it; but there’s a loop-hole all the same. Besides,
we can’t afford to ignore possible motives, and
there’s no question that he came here for one
purpose only—to get the Talisman. Leave Wraxall in,
eh? We’re trying to be inclusive, remember.”</p>

<p>“Wraxall’s a good sort,” was Douglas’s verdict.
“I can’t think he’s the man we’re after. But leave
him in, since we can’t count him as definitely
cleared.”</p>

<p>“Freddie?”</p>

<p>“I’m all for keeping Freddie under observation.
I don’t say he took the thing, of course. Can’t go
that length. But the line he’s followed all along
has been just the sort of thing he might have been
expected to do, if he were the man we want. Who
would suspect him, when he volunteered as a sleuth
from Sleuth Town? Good bit of camouflage for a
criminal, I think. And he had a very poor account
to give of himself when it came to the pinch, very
thin. Freddie stays in, so far as I’m concerned.”</p>

<p>“My feeling too. Well, that leaves only two more,
both Dangerfields: Eric and Helga. I’m not an
enthusiast for Eric. Rather a rotter, it seems to
me. But there’s nothing very definite against him;
we agreed on that before.”</p>

<p>“Leave him in, then,” Douglas decided. “We
can’t say more than ‘not proven’ for him, can we?”</p>

<p>“That brings us to Helga. I say, Douglas, did
you make anything of that affair to-night? The
girl wasn’t lying. Neither was Eileen.”</p>

<p>“That was what I felt,” concurred Douglas.
“Neither of ’em was lying, to my mind. And yet
the thing seems flatly impossible unless one of them
was giving the truth a pretty wide miss.”</p>

<p>“It might have been someone else in a similar
dressing-gown,” suggested Westenhanger,
half-heartedly.</p>

<p>“No good, Conway. The only other women
available are Mrs. Dangerfield and Mrs. Scorton.
They’re both rather under middle height. Helga’s
a well-built girl, taller than the average. There
could be no mistake about it.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger cogitated for a time.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he said, at last. “It’s self-evident.
Eileen was wide awake, obviously. But suppose
Helga walks in her sleep? She wouldn’t know she’d
been there at all, if she got back to bed eventually
without waking up. That would account for the
affair, wouldn’t it? It’s the only simple solution.
It might even explain other things as well.”</p>

<p>He ruminated for a few more seconds before
continuing.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Eileen about it to-morrow. She was
excited at that time, or she’d probably have spotted
it as somnambulism at once. Perhaps she’ll
remember something if she thinks over it. This may turn
out to be the key to the whole damned thing.”</p>

<h2>Chapter X</h2>

<p>Mrs. Brent’s intervention did nothing to relax the
tension in the social atmosphere of Friocksheim;
on the contrary, it increased the general discomfort
of the situation. Up to the moment of her
reappearance, some attempt had been made, by common
consent, to smooth over the awkwardness of things;
but after her revelations it was inevitable that the
guests should separate into inimical camps. On the
surface a casual observer might have detected
nothing amiss, since any display of open animosity
would have made inevitable the scandal which all of
them wished to avoid. Freddie Stickney and
Morchard were treated with a distant and rigid courtesy
which in itself emphasised the existence of new
conditions. Beyond that, they were ignored by almost
all the others. Mrs. Caistor Scorton alone seemed
to keep them on the old footing, and she thus served
as a link between the two parties.</p>

<p>How much Rollo Dangerfield knew—or
suspected—Westenhanger was unable to conjecture. Mrs.
Brent, Helga, or Eric might have opened the old
man’s eyes. Whether they had done so or not, his
old-fashioned courtesy seemed to make no
distinctions among his guests; and Westenhanger was left
in doubt as to whether Rollo was still in complete
ignorance or else, knowing the facts, he put his
duties as a host before his private feelings as
regarded Morchard and Freddie.</p>

<p>On the morning after the <i>Kestrel’s</i> arrival,
Westenhanger attached himself to Eileen and persuaded
her to go with him to a quiet part of the gardens,
where they were unlikely to be interrupted. He was
anxious to secure what information he could about
the appearance of Helga Dangerfield on the night
of the storm, and he lost very little time in coming
to the point.</p>

<p>“I was rather puzzled by that incident you
mentioned last night,” he said, as they picked out a
secluded seat. “Your meeting Helga in the
corridor, I mean. Anyone could see that you were both
telling the truth, and yet it sounds a bit impossible,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I was puzzled, too. I saw her quite plainly,
hardly much farther off than you are just
now.”</p>

<p>“Had you both got candles?”</p>

<p>“No, she had none; but I saw her quite
distinctly by the light of my own.”</p>

<p>“The electric lights weren’t on?”</p>

<p>“No. But I could see perfectly plainly, except
that a draught made my candle flicker. I
recognised her dressing-gown. And no one could mistake
her height and her walk—you know that way she
carries herself, quite unmistakable, so graceful.
Oh, it was she, undoubtedly.”</p>

<p>“Did you see her face, by any chance? Did she
look towards you?”</p>

<p>“No. She passed by as if she hadn’t noticed me.
I thought she hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“With your light in your hand? Curious, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>Eileen considered the matter for some seconds
without replying. Then her face lighted up.</p>

<p>“Oh, now I see what you mean! Of course! It
was stupid of me not to think of that immediately.
She was walking in her sleep?”</p>

<p>“It would account for the affair, if she were?
I mean, that idea fits with what you remember,
does it?”</p>

<p>“Of course it does! I ought to have thought of
it for myself, at once. But I never knew anyone
who walked in their sleep. It’s always been outside
my experience, and I rather disbelieved most of the
tales I’ve heard about it. So it didn’t suggest itself
to me until you mentioned the candle in my hand.
Of course, then I saw at once that she couldn’t
help seeing me if she had been awake.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we assume she’s a somnambulist.
She doesn’t know she walks in her sleep. That’s
evident. For if she knows she’s subject to it, she’d
have seen the explanation for herself at once;
whereas she was just as puzzled as you were over the
thing. Now doesn’t that suggest something further
to you?”</p>

<p>Eileen knitted her brows for a moment or two
before she saw his meaning.</p>

<p>“The Talisman?” she asked finally.</p>

<p>“Yes. Suppose she took it away that night. She
may have concealed it somewhere and clean
forgotten—or never known, rather—that she had ever
touched it.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face showed her surprise at this
suggestion.</p>

<p>“Do you know, that’s wonderfully clever! I
really believe you’ve come very near the mark.
And wouldn’t it be a relief if it turned out to be
true? There’d be no thief after all.”</p>

<p>“If some of them turned out to be thieves, I
don’t know that it would lower them much in my
opinion now,” Westenhanger observed, elliptically.</p>

<p>Eileen avoided a direct reply.</p>

<p>“What I meant was that this cloud of suspicion
would be swept away and most of us could get back
to normal again. It’s no use pretending that we’re
enjoying Friocksheim just now.”</p>

<p>Before Westenhanger could say anything further,
Nina Lindale appeared, crossing the lawn before
them. Eileen beckoned to her.</p>

<p>“Nina, did you borrow my mirror by any chance?”</p>

<p>Nina Lindale shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, never saw it. You mean your silver one
with your initials on the back? It was on your
dressing-table a couple of days ago.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Cynthia’s got it,” Eileen conjectured.</p>

<p>“She’s just behind me,” Nina told her. “You
can ask her when she comes along. Tell her I’ve
gone down to the cove, if she asks. We’re going
to bathe.”</p>

<p>She nodded her thanks and took the path leading
to the bathing-place. A few minutes after she had
gone, Cynthia appeared in her turn; but she also
failed to throw any light on the matter of the
mirror.</p>

<p>“Sorry I can’t help, but I never set my eyes on
the thing. Most annoying to have it go amissing,
Eileen. Take mine any time you want it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I can’t imagine what’s become of my
own, though. It’s not the sort of thing one
mislays.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’ll turn up all right. I shouldn’t worry.
Won’t you people come down and bathe? It’s just
the morning for it.”</p>

<p>They allowed themselves to be persuaded.</p>

<p>Westenhanger paid little attention to the incident
of the mirror. His mind was busy with a scheme
which had been concerted between himself and
Douglas on the previous night. The list of suspects
had now been reduced to four; and it only remained
to discover the left-handed person in this limited
group.</p>

<p>A midday change in the weather favoured their
plans. During lunch a thin rain began, and it soon
became evident that the afternoon would be wet.
With a little tactful management, the two men
succeeded in carrying off Wraxall and Eric
Dangerfield to the billiard-room.</p>

<p>“What about it?” inquired Douglas, indicating
the cue-rack.</p>

<p>Eric shook his head with a smile.</p>

<p>“Leave me out,” he said, indicating his lame
ankle. “I can’t stand on two feet with any comfort
yet, much less lean over the table.”</p>

<p>“You, then, Wraxall?” Douglas suggested.</p>

<p>But the American declined his offer.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you play. I’m not in your class.”</p>

<p>“Give you a reasonable number of points to make
a game of it.”</p>

<p>It was quite obvious that Wraxall did not care
to play, and Douglas refrained from pressing him.
Westenhanger looked out of the window.</p>

<p>“A soaker of a day! We’ll have to put in the
time somehow. Come along, Douglas. We’re
bored stiff. Trot out some of your parlour tricks
and keep us amused. Anything’s better than
nothing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite like the way you put it, Conway,”
protested Douglas, with a grin. “You haven’t just
got the knack of the felicitous phrase, as it were.
You mean well, and all that; but somehow you don’t
just bring it off.”</p>

<p>“Produce you’re latest, anyhow. The only
stipulation I make is that you don’t try to interest us in
Find the Lady or the Elusive Pea. These are
barred. But if you can make any money off me by
other methods, you’re welcome to it.”</p>

<p>He sat down and the others followed his example.
Douglas considered for a moment and then took a
Swan vesta box from his pocket.</p>

<p>“My sleight of hand’s a bit rusty, I’m afraid,”
he apologised. “But perhaps I might manage to
pull off this one if you haven’t seen it before. Got
a florin by any chance, Wraxall?”</p>

<p>The American searched his pockets.</p>

<p>“A florin,” he inquired, “that’s what you call a
two-shilling piece, isn’t it? This coinage of yours
always makes me want to think before I can be sure
about it.”</p>

<p>He found his florin and handed it across to
Douglas, who refused it.</p>

<p>“No,” he explained, “I don’t want you to say I
palmed the thing. Observe carefully.”</p>

<p>He slid the match-box half open and, holding the
box so that they could all see plainly, he placed a
florin of his own among the matches.</p>

<p>“My coin’s under the picture of the Swan, you
see?”</p>

<p>He closed the box and handed it over to
Wraxall.</p>

<p>“Now put your florin in at the other end of the
box. You can mark your coin, if you like.”</p>

<p>Wraxall contented himself with noting the date
of the florin before putting it in.</p>

<p>“Now shut the box,” directed Douglas, “and hand
it over to me. Just chuck it across.”</p>

<p>Wraxall did so. Douglas caught it and held it
out so that it was well away from his sleeve.</p>

<p>“This is the sticky bit,” he announced. “Are
you all sure that both coins are in the box?
Quite sure? Well, seeing’s believing. Have a
look.”</p>

<p>Holding the box in one hand, he slid the inner
case forward with his finger until one coin showed.
Then, without using his left hand, he reversed the
box and showed the other end open, so that they
could satisfy themselves that the two coins were still
there.</p>

<p>“All content? Four bob in the box? I’ll just
show you them again.”</p>

<p>He did so. As he closed the box for the last time,
his voice changed as though he were trying to
suppress his satisfaction at having got through his
sleight of hand without detection.</p>

<p>“Now, Wraxall. I’ll sell you the box as it stands
for three bob. Take the offer?”</p>

<p>Wraxall pondered for an instant.</p>

<p>“It’s this coinage bother,” he explained. “Three
bob? That’s three shillings, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m offering to self you the thing for three
shillings. You think it contains four shillings—two
florins. I don’t guarantee that. I simply sell the
box, matches included with the other contents.
Going . . . going . . .”</p>

<p>“I take you!” snapped Wraxall, certain that he
would have detected any legerdemain.</p>

<p>“Right-o!” agreed Douglas, pleasantly. “You
win. Here’s the box. I’ll just go through the
formality of collecting your three bob, though.”</p>

<p>He tossed the box over to Wraxall, who caught it
and paid Douglas three shillings. The conjurer
grinned mockingly.</p>

<p>“Quite satisfied with your bargain? Have a look
inside the box. Both florins present and correct?
You’ll be glad to see <em>your own one again</em>!”</p>

<p>Wraxall saw the point almost immediately.</p>

<p>“Confound you, Fairmile! You’ve had the nerve
to sell me my own florin! So I’ve paid three
shillings for <em>your</em> florin. Is that it? And you muddled
me up with all this talk about sleight of hand.
That’s neat. That’s very neat indeed.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s your three shillings,” said Douglas
tossing them across one by one. “Now I’ll take
my florin and we’re back at the start again. I’d be
ashamed to rob anyone by that trick.”</p>

<p>“You mean you’d hate to take advantage of the
weak-minded?” corrected the American, accepting
his discomfiture with a smile.</p>

<p>“No. That trick’s really an obstinacy corrector.
You’d be astonished to see how often it comes off—five
times out of six at the lowest, I’ve found. Well,
here’s another.”</p>

<p>He turned to Eric Dangerfield.</p>

<p>“Got four pennies by any chance.”</p>

<p>Eric searched his pockets and found the required
coins.</p>

<p>“Now to avoid disputes later,” Douglas explained,
“you’ll count ’em out one by one on to the table
beside you.”</p>

<p>Eric carefully counted out the four coins, putting
them down one at a time.</p>

<p>“Four, I make it,” he stated.</p>

<p>Douglas held out his hand with the fingers
outspread.</p>

<p>“See it? Quite empty? No trap-doors or magic
cabinets concealed anywhere? See the back too?
Well, put your pennies into my palm. . . . I now
close my hand. I take out my handkerchief. I
shake it, showing that no coin is concealed in it. I
cover my hand. Now, I say I’ve got <em>five</em> pennies
in my hand. You can take off the handkerchief, if
you like. <em>Five</em> pennies. Give me a bob if I’m
wrong?”</p>

<p>Eric Dangerfield had been watching closely.</p>

<p>“All right,” he agreed.</p>

<p>“Well, then. I <em>am</em> wrong, and you owe me a bob.
I didn’t bet I was right. I said, ‘Give me a bob if
I’m <em>wrong</em>.’ ”</p>

<p>Eric Dangerfield fished out a shilling but Douglas
refused to take it. He was about to continue the
prearranged series of tests when, to his surprise,
Westenhanger introduced a variation in the
programme.</p>

<p>“Before I forget, Douglas, you might give me
the name of the place where you got that new
racket. I want to make a note of it.”</p>

<p>He felt in his pockets, then applied to Eric.</p>

<p>“Got a fountain pen, by any chance,
Dangerfield?”</p>

<p>Eric took one from his waistcoat pocket and
offered it to Westenhanger, who had pulled out a
piece of paper. Westenhanger put out his hand and
then withdrew it again.</p>

<p>“I hate using anyone else’s pen for fear of
spoiling the nib. I write heavier than most people.
Would you mind jotting the address down?”</p>

<p>Eric wrote down the address which Douglas gave,
and both men noted that he used his pen in the
normal way. Westenhanger put the paper in his
pocket and again surprised Douglas by going to the
window and looking out.</p>

<p>“It’s clearing up a bit. What about some fresh
air, Douglas?”</p>

<p>This was the prearranged signal for breaking off
operations; but Douglas was puzzled by its coming
so early.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” he agreed. “If you want to get
soaked, I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Eric could not be expected to join them, and
Wraxall, for the sake of politeness, had to stay
behind to keep the lame man company. As soon
as they were well away from the house, Douglas
showed his surprise.</p>

<p>“You broke that off a bit soon, Conway. Of
course, I’m quite satisfied. They’re both
right-handed. Wraxall handed the box and grabbed at
the shillings quite according to plan; and
Dangerfield counted his lot of coins in the normal way.
But I’d liked to have worked a few more stunts on
them, just for certainty’s sake.”</p>

<p>“Not worth while,” Westenhanger said. “I’ve
got something absolutely certain to go on. As it
happens, you’re wrong, Douglas. Wraxall is
right-handed. But the other fellow is ambidextrous. He
uses his right hand for hand-movements; but when
his arm comes in, he’s left-handed.”</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” demanded
Douglas in surprise.</p>

<p>“Just an accidental observation. He carries his
fountain pen in his right-hand waistcoat pocket.
You and I carry ours in the left pocket, so as to
get at it easily with our right hands. He uses his
left hand to take it from his pocket, and then he
passes the pen to his right hand before he uses it.
You see he uses his arm in taking it out, and he’s
left-armed. That’s absolutely conclusive to my
mind, and I didn’t want to run any chance of
arousing suspicion by going through the whole programme.
I think we’ve got our man.”</p>

<p>“That was pretty cute. I was watching him,
but I didn’t spot the thing, although I was on the
look-out for it.”</p>

<p>“It was just a bit of luck. Nothing to boast
about.”</p>

<p>Douglas considered for a time.</p>

<p>“Well, where do we stand? Motive? He’s hard
up and lost a lot at cards. Opportunity? He was
wandering about the house late that night.
Besides, his room is close to the one the Talisman was
in. He’s left-armed—the type we’re looking for.
He went up to town next morning—possibly to get
the thing out of the house for fear of a search,
even if he didn’t dispose of it in some way
then—pawning or some such business. And, by the way,
he’s got lamed in some way. I wonder if there is a
man-trap after all, and he got mixed up in it
slightly.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger listened to this catalogue with a
gloomy face.</p>

<p>“There isn’t an atom of real proof in the whole
lot. We could never satisfy anyone on the strength
of that stuff alone. I’d never mention a word to
anyone about it, Douglas; because we must have
definite proof. And I don’t quite see our next
move.”</p>

<p>“Watch him, and keep on watching, on the chance
of something turning up, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“It’s a poor chance,” said Westenhanger.</p>

<p>That idea remained with him for the rest of the
day. The step-by-step process of elimination had
been carried through with complete success; but it
was useless to pretend to himself that the result was
conclusive evidence. At the best it became a case
of “Not Proven”: a moral certainty, perhaps, but
nothing more. Something further was needed to
establish the identity of the culprit beyond doubt.
And the more he puzzled over the problem, the less
chance could he see of bringing the thing home. One
might devise a scheme for trapping a fellow-guest;
but how could one out-manœuvre a man working
on his own ground with complete knowledge of all
the possibilities of the environment?</p>

<p>Even when he went to bed, Westenhanger lay
awake seeking some solution of the problem. At
last he realised that he was unlikely to get any
further forward; but by that time he had fretted
himself into a state of complete wakefulness.</p>

<p>“No use going on like this,” he reflected at last.
“I must get something to take my mind off the
thing. It’s infernally tantalising to be so near it
and yet not to hit on the right track. I’ll go down
to the library and get a book. I can read myself to
sleep all right—push the affair out of my thoughts.
If I lie here I’ll simply worry at it till morning.”</p>

<p>He got up and put on his dressing-gown. His
watch showed him that it was in the small hours;
and all the house was quiet. He opened his door
cautiously, took his candle with him, and went down
the stairs.</p>

<p>When he reached the hall below, he was surprised
to find a light shining from the open door of old
Dangerfield’s study; and as he came opposite the
room he looked in. Rollo was sitting, fully dressed,
beside the fire; and at the sound of Westenhanger’s
approach he glanced up. Westenhanger, feeling
that his midnight perambulations demanded some
explanation, turned into the study. Rollo showed
no surprise but invited him to sit down on the
opposite side of the hearth.</p>

<p>“Got a touch of insomnia, to-night,” explained
Westenhanger, “so I thought I’d come down for a
book and see if I could read myself to sleep. I was
just on the way to the library when I saw the light
in here.”</p>

<p>Rollo’s face expressed some concern.</p>

<p>“I hope you aren’t subject to it,” he said.
“Anything going wrong with one’s sleep is a terrible
thing.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger detected more feeling in the
comment than he had expected; and for a moment he
was surprised. Then it flashed across his mind that
Rollo probably knew of Helga’s somnambulism and
had thus a keener interest in such matters than
most people. He hastened to reassure the old man.</p>

<p>“No; it’s not chronic. Just a touch of it one gets
at times.”</p>

<p>A fleeting expression changed Rollo Dangerfield’s
face for an instant; but it was gone before
Westenhanger could identify it.</p>

<p>“I sometimes get it myself when I’m worried,”
said old Dangerfield. “It’s a bad business if it gets
a firm hold on one. You’re not worried about
anything, I hope?” he added, sympathetically.</p>

<p>Westenhanger hardly cared to tell a downright
lie.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing in particular, nothing to do with
my own affairs,” he said, trying to pass the matter
off lightly.</p>

<p>But Rollo fastened upon the tacit admission.</p>

<p>“You are worried, then? I’m very sorry.
Nothing serious, I trust?”</p>

<p>Then, as if suddenly struck by a thought, he
demanded:</p>

<p>“It’s not this Talisman affair, is it?”</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, Westenhanger’s face betrayed
him. Rollo’s eyes missed nothing.</p>

<p>“You really mustn’t worry over that. The
Talisman is all right, I assure you. If that were the
only worry I had, I should count myself fortunate.”</p>

<p>He broke off in order to listen for something; and
Westenhanger could see that his ears were strained
to catch some faint sound, which he evidently
expected. After a few seconds the old man’s vigilance
seemed to relax; his eyes still turned to the open
door, but apparently he was satisfied that nothing
was coming. Westenhanger had little difficulty in
reading the situation. Rollo was on guard to watch
over his daughter if she found her way downstairs
during her sleep-walking. Then, suddenly, it
occurred to him that Rollo’s post lay on the road to
the Corinthian’s Room. Could it be that the old
man had some idea that Helga’s somnambulism was
connected with the loss of the Talisman? She might
have taken it during her sleep, and he might be
watching her to discover, if possible, where she had
concealed it. He resolved to push his inquiries, even
at the cost of some failure in courtesy.</p>

<p>“I believe, Mr. Dangerfield, that you know all
the time what has become of the Talisman. Is that
why its disappearance doesn’t worry you?”</p>

<p>Rollo’s eyes grew suddenly stern.</p>

<p>“Do you suggest that I am shielding anyone?”
he demanded, bluntly. “That’s rather a grave
charge.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t brought by me,” Westenhanger
exclaimed. Put in that precise form, the matter took
on an aspect which he had not considered at all.
“Certainly I never suggested such a thing! I never
so much as thought of it.”</p>

<p>Rollo acknowledged this with a slight inclination
of his head. Then, after a time, he spoke again.</p>

<p>“I could hardly complain if some such idea came
into your mind. But no matter how strong the
motive, I doubt if I would yield to it in this case.
I would never dream of letting a guest of mine lie
under suspicion when a word from me would clear
up the matter. Never. Besides, whom could I
shield?”</p>

<p>He met Westenhanger’s eye frankly.</p>

<p>“There are only two possible people: Eric and
Helga. You might suspect either of them; but
what does it amount to? Eric could have taken the
thing, undoubtedly. He may have reasons for
taking it. He’s left-handed, like the thief. . . .”</p>

<p>“You knew the thief was left-handed?” asked
Westenhanger in surprise.</p>

<p>“So did you, evidently,” the old man retorted,
unmoved. “It was obvious to anyone who saw how
the cabinet was opened.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Westenhanger, rather crestfallen
to find that another person had arrived at the same
conclusion by the same line of reasoning.</p>

<p>“But Eric didn’t take the Talisman,” the old man
continued. “You will have to take my word for
that. I can’t, of course, prove it to you. It’s a
difficult business, proving a negative. But I give
you my word of honour that Eric didn’t take it.
Eric knows what he knows. He wouldn’t take it.”</p>

<p>“You mean the Dangerfield Secret?” demanded
Westenhanger, astonished to find that matter
cropping up in this connection.</p>

<p>“If you choose to call it so,” said old Rollo,
dismissing the matter by his tone. “But if I am not
supposed to be shielding Eric—and I am not
shielding him, as I told you—then it must be . . .”</p>

<p>He broke off sharply and held up his hand in
caution. Westenhanger, listening with all his ears,
heard the faint sound of a step on the staircase.
Rollo rose silently to his feet with another gesture
of warning and stepped lightly over to the door.
Almost as he reached it, Helga’s figure appeared in
the corridor. She passed without a look aside,
though the glare of the lighted room fell full on her
face as she went by.</p>

<p>Old Rollo softly switched on the corridor lights
and fell in behind her. Westenhanger, picking his
steps with caution, followed. Helga, unconscious
of their presence, led them down to the door of the
Corinthian’s Room, which she entered.
Westenhanger had a hope that possibly her movements
might throw light upon the mystery; but when he
reached the door, Rollo had switched on the lights,
and it soon grew clear that she had no interest in the
cabinet. She wandered aimlessly about the room
for a time, then returned to the door and came out
again, the two men standing aside to let her pass.</p>

<p>Rollo waited until she had gone some distance
down the corridor, then he whispered to
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“Please put out the lights; I must see her safely
back to her room.”</p>

<p>Their figures retreated down the stretch, turned
at the staircase and disappeared. Westenhanger
waited for a time. Then, remembering the original
object of his journey, he passed into the library,
selected a book, and went upstairs to his room, after
extinguishing the lights. But his book helped him
very little.</p>

<p>“Old Rollo was speaking the truth, I’m sure. He
doesn’t believe Eric’s mixed up in the thing at all,”
he mused. “But that doesn’t necessarily prove that
Eric didn’t take it after all. We’ve eliminated
everyone except Eric. He’s the only one who fits
the facts. And yet old Dangerfield spoke as if he
had absolute certainty. What was it he said?
‘He knows what he knows.’ But what does he
know? This Dangerfield Secret? Is there some
deadly business connected with the guarding of the
Talisman, so dangerous that no one would risk
touching it ‘if he knows what he knows’? The old
man, if I read him right, isn’t a mystery-monger
for the sheer love of it. There never was a less
theatrical person; he’s natural all through, and
absolutely straight.”</p>

<p>His thoughts turned to the scene he had just
witnessed.</p>

<p>“No wonder the poor old chap’s worried. A
sleep-walking daughter is enough to worry anyone.
There’s no saying what mischief she might get into.”</p>

<p>A fresh line opened up his mind.</p>

<p>“He said he wasn’t shielding anyone. Did he
mean merely that he wasn’t covering up a theft?
If Helga took the thing while she was asleep, there
would be no question of ‘shielding’ at all. I wish
that girl hadn’t arrived just when she did. She
interrupted him just at the critical moment.
Perhaps he knows she took it and is simply waiting to
get it back eventually. That would account for all
this coolness under a huge loss. It wouldn’t be a
real loss at all. The thing’s bound to be somewhere
near by; it’s only a case of laying hands on it
eventually. She’d be sure to give it away sooner or
later if she goes on sleep-walking. And that’s one
of the reasons why he was watching for her to-night,
perhaps.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XI</h2>

<p>On the following day, Westenhanger took the
earliest opportunity of informing Douglas about the
developments in the night. He had been strongly
impressed by old Dangerfield’s denial of Eric’s
responsibility, and he felt that it would be unfair to
suppress this information and so leave suspicion
afloat in his friend’s mind.</p>

<p>“Well, we can take the old man’s word for it,”
was Douglas’s verdict, when he had heard the whole
story. “He wouldn’t tell a lie, I’m sure of that.
And, apparently, from what you say, he thought he
had good enough grounds, though he didn’t throw
much light on them.”</p>

<p>“He convinced me. I’m quite satisfied, now, we’re
on the wrong track.”</p>

<p>“Then the great elimination stunt has been a
wash-out?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger gloomily accepted this estimate.</p>

<p>“It’s landed us with the wrong man. I can’t help
feeling that,” he said. “By the way, Douglas, is
Helga left-handed by any chance?”</p>

<p>“No. I’ve played golf and tennis with her, and
she’s as right-handed as anyone, as far as I can
see.”</p>

<p>“Then we can exclude her.”</p>

<p>“So it’s a case of the Ten Little Nigger
Boys—‘and then there was none’?”</p>

<p>“It looks like it. Elimination’s a sound enough
system; but we’ve gone off the track somewhere,
evidently. We started with three tests, didn’t we?
Left-handedness—Motive—and Opportunity. I still
believe in the left-handedness. It’s the only
definite thing we’ve got, even if it has proved a
wash-out in this Eric affair.”</p>

<p>Douglas nodded assent to this.</p>

<p>“Then there must be something wrong with the
others, evidently. Suppose we drop the
opportunity factor. Really, anyone might have been abroad
that night and no one would know about it except
by chance.”</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>

<p>“That leaves motive. I don’t see how we’re
going to get beyond our earlier notions on that point.”</p>

<p>“Slipped a cog, somewhere, then? Just what I
was thinking. And I think I know where it slipped.
I’ve seen something that made me sit up somewhat.
Let’s stick to left-handedness as a sure winner, for
a change, and see if I can’t throw some light on
things.”</p>

<p>“What did you see?”</p>

<p>Douglas lit a cigarette before replying.</p>

<p>“Last night,” he went on, “while you and Eileen
were wandering around outside, admiring the moon
after dinner, our three pariahs—Freddie, Morchard,
and Mrs. Scorton—got up a little game of
cut-throat. I expect they felt a bit chary of asking
any of the rest of us to make up a four. At any
rate, they were playing three-handed, and I
happened to be sitting across the room. I wasn’t so
engrossed in Cynthia’s conversation that I couldn’t
keep one eye on their table now and again.”</p>

<p>“Get on with it,” advised Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“Now this is what I saw,” continued Douglas,
seriously. “Freddie and Morchard are normal,
beyond a doubt. I watched ’em very carefully, and
that’s a cert. But the fair lady deals with her left
hand. Strange I never noticed it before; but one
seldom looks at a dealer, except casually, I suppose.
However, there it is.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger considered the matter for a time
without comment.</p>

<p>“There’s no motive,” he concluded. Then his
memory spontaneously threw up the incident of
Eileen Cressage’s mirror. “But perhaps that’s
where we went wrong. We’ve been on the hunt for
a motive the whole time, Douglas. What about
scrapping that notion and trying kleptomania for a
change?”</p>

<p>“I was just working up to that point myself.”</p>

<p>“Well, Eileen’s silver mirror was taken from her
room the other day. That’s another motiveless
affair—even more so than the Talisman.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that puts a new face on things. I didn’t
know about that. And I can put something else in
the kitty, judging from that. Mrs. Brent’s gold
wrist-watch has gone astray. She’s been hunting
for it all over the place. Of course I never thought
of it having been taken. But this mirror-affair
connects ’em up nicely. It’s just the pointless sort of
snatching that one might expect, if your notion’s
right.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let’s be in too much of a hurry this
time,” cautioned Westenhanger. “We made
average asses of ourselves with our last dip in the
lucky-bag. It looks as if we might be nearer the centre
this time; but we’re up against the same old bother.
How’re we going to prove anything?”</p>

<p>Douglas moved uneasily in his seat.</p>

<p>“I’m not over-keen on the job, Conway, and that’s
a fact. The only way of clearing the thing up is to
watch her. And I don’t quite fancy the job of
spy.”</p>

<p>“No more do I. But if her hands are clean,
watching won’t do any harm so long as nobody else
knows about it. And if she’s the thief, she deserves
all she gets. She did all she could to put the blame
at Eileen’s door—don’t forget that, Douglas. And
if you do, I’m not likely to let it slip my memory.
That was outside the rules of the game, as Mrs.
Brent says.”</p>

<p>Somewhat ruefully, Douglas admitted the justice
of this view.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re right, Conway. I see your
case all right. But,” he added firmly, “not even
the best of causes is going to make me put on false
whiskers or reach-me-downs. Worming one’s way
into people’s confidence is also barred. Likewise
overhearing conversations. Anything in the way
of measuring foot-prints or hanging around pubs,
will be cheerfully carried out; but nothing of an
ungenteel nature will be handled by this firm. That’s
that!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Douglas. It won’t even run to a
false nose. All I propose to do is to keep my eyes
open.”</p>

<p>“Dashed moderate, I call it. Trade Union hours,
then. You can have the night shift if you like. I
feel generous this morning.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger guessed what was at the back of
Douglas’s reluctance.</p>

<p>“Get one thing clearly into your mind, Douglas.
You’re not spying on a woman—you’re watching for
a thief. Give chivalry a miss. It’s quite out of
place after what’s happened.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Douglas conceded, “if you put it
that way I suppose it can be done. I’ll regard it
partly as a medical case: Kleptomania—its Cause,
Detection, and Cure. That makes it seem a bit
more respectable. Frankly, Conway, it’s not a job
I like very much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t revel in it,” Westenhanger admitted,
gruffly. “But I’m going to see it through, if I can.
Somebody ought to pay for the trouble they’ve
caused.”</p>

<p>Douglas looked away.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, at last, “I suppose if it had been
Cynthia instead of Eileen I’d be inclined to go in
with both feet. I see your point, Conway. I’ll keep
my eyes open.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger made no reply.</p>

<p>When he considered the matter later on, Conway
Westenhanger had to admit to himself that he had
embarked upon a forlorn hope. Nothing but pure
luck was likely to bring the thing to success. And
the chances against any result seemed tremendous.
He could not dog his quarry continuously for any
length of time, since that would inevitably lead to a
disclosure of his intentions. For a large part of the
day and during most of the night Mrs. Caistor
Scorton would be outside his sphere of observation,
and that left him very little chance of success. The
possibility of enlisting assistance he rejected
immediately. None of the party was likely to be useful.
Eileen was the only one whom he might have
approached in the matter and the relations between
her and Mrs. Caistor Scorton made her worse than
useless for that particular purpose, apart from all
other objections to the idea. Westenhanger resigned
himself to waiting for the help of chance, with a
full appreciation of the odds against success.</p>

<p>That night he and Douglas sat up later than usual.
All the other guests had gone earlier to bed and the
house was dark. As the two men came out into the
corridor they found the door of Rollo Dangerfield’s
study wide open, and a beam of light shone from it
across the floor.</p>

<p>“The old man’s on guard again,” Westenhanger
hazarded to Douglas in a low voice. “He’s having
a worrying time, I’m afraid. Hard lines having a
thing like that on one’s shoulders.”</p>

<p>But when they passed the open door they found
Eric on the watch instead of his uncle. He wished
them good-night as they went by, but showed no
desire for their company.</p>

<p>“They’re taking it in turns, evidently,” Douglas
guessed as they went up the stairs. “Ah! perhaps
that accounts for Eric being about in the small hours,
that night of the storm. It may have been his turn
for duty. We don’t know how long this affair has
been going on.”</p>

<p>“That’s probably it,” Westenhanger agreed.
“But if he were sitting up how did the thief get into
the Corinthian’s Room undetected?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I expect Helga only walks about once in the
night; and once they’ve seen her safe back to her
room they can go to bed themselves. After that,
the coast would be clear. You remember I saw
the Talisman in its place about one in the
morning?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger went to bed that night with the
consciousness that he had accomplished absolutely
nothing during the day. He had trusted to luck,
but luck had not served. His hopes were gradually
lessening as time went on.</p>

<p>“Something may turn up,” he reflected, without
optimism, as he undressed.</p>

<p>Something did “turn up”; but it was the last
thing that he could have foreseen. On coming down
to breakfast next morning he found Freddie
Stickney busily spreading the news to Nina, Cynthia and
Douglas.</p>

<p>“Heard the latest?” Freddie demanded as
Westenhanger entered the room. “The Talisman’s turned
up again—safe in its cabinet once more, just as
old Dangerfield prophesied.”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger was completely taken aback by
the news.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” Freddie assured him. “You
don’t catch me swallowing things on mere hearsay.
I’ve been along to the Corinthian’s Room myself
and had a look. And there it is, as large as life.
Stuck under the glass bell, just as it used to be.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger took his seat at the table without
comment. This latest episode in the chain of events
seemed beyond understanding. Given that a thief
had taken the Talisman, why had the thing come
back at all? All that the thief had to do was to leave
it in its original place of concealment, if he feared
detection. To put it back in the cabinet was to run
a second risk of being discovered, especially now that
one of the Dangerfields was on guard over Helga
each night. And if it was not a case of theft, why
remove the thing at all? Before he could continue
his line of thought he was interrupted.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?” Freddie was taking
up his rôle of general inquisitor once more. “It
seems a bit rum, doesn’t it? And old Dangerfield’s
had the laugh, after all. He swore it would turn up
again—and here it is! Queer, eh?”</p>

<p>“Very strange,” Westenhanger agreed coldly.</p>

<p>Freddie was outside the scope of suspicion now,
but Westenhanger had other reasons for disliking
him. And what infernal impudence of the little
brute to start this kind of thing again after the fiasco
of his last effort in the business. Freddie,
however, was not to be discouraged by coldness. His
bright little eyes flickered from face to face, and he
continued his remarks quite unperturbed by the
obviously hostile atmosphere.</p>

<p>“What’s that old tag about the man who finds
a thing being the one who knows where to look for
it?” he went on. “I begin to think it’s a practical
joke after all. The old man’s been pulling our legs!
He laid off all that stuff about the Talisman being
able to look after itself. Then he took it away
himself that night, eh? And now he brings it back
again, and he laughs in his sleeve at us. How’s that,
umpire?”</p>

<p>He glanced round the table for applause, but
received none.</p>

<p>“If you ask me, Freddie,” Douglas pronounced
bluntly, “it proves two things up to the hilt. One
is that you have the nerve to sit down at breakfast
and criticise your host behind his back. The other
is that you don’t know Mr. Dangerfield. He’s the
last man who’d play a silly game of that sort.
Anyone with two ounces of grey matter in his skull would
see that.”</p>

<p>Douglas’s rebuke would have silenced most people,
but Freddie’s skin was proof against even this
attack.</p>

<p>“Think so?” he asked blandly. “Well, what
better theory have you got yourself?”</p>

<p>Douglas took no notice of the query.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m very glad Mr. Dangerfield has got it
back,” Nina said, ignoring Freddie’s remark. “It’s
been so uncomfortable all the time to feel that he’d
lost a thing like that—a thing he cared for so much.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t seem to worry over it,” Freddie
reminded her.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dangerfield’s a thoroughbred,” Cynthia
commented. “No matter how he felt about it he’d
never show it to us.”</p>

<p>“You think not? No? Well, perhaps not,” the
irrepressible Freddie conceded graciously. “That’s
one way of looking at it, certainly.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger took no part in the talk. His mind
was busy with the task of fitting this new evidence
to the earlier events. If a thief had taken the thing,
why had the Talisman come back? The only
possible explanation was that the thief had taken fright.
But why should he take fright? So far as
Westenhanger knew, nothing had come out which made
the solution of the problem any clearer, and only
imminent exposure could have forced the culprit
to disgorge. Days had passed since the loss of
the Talisman. There had been plenty of time to
get it into a place of safe concealment. Why take
the risk of replacing it in the cabinet? There
seemed to be no plausible answer to that question.</p>

<p>But if it wasn’t a thief, then it must have been
one of the Dangerfields. One could leave old Rollo
out of the business. He was the last man to play
a practical joke on his guests—especially a practical
joke which carried a tang as nasty as this affair did.
Helga was another possible agent, and an innocent
agent if it did turn out that she had a hand in the
thing. Westenhanger began to incline towards this
solution. But then Helga, according to Douglas,
was right-handed, while the Talisman had been
removed by someone who was obviously left-handed.
Perhaps one turned left-handed in one’s sleep. But
on recalling fragments of his dreams, Westenhanger
had to admit that he remembered himself as
right-handed during his sleep. That seemed to exclude
Helga.</p>

<p>Then it flashed across his mind that Eric had been
on the watch on both nights, on the date of the
Talisman’s vanishing and—last night—when it
returned. He had the place to himself on both
occasions, and could do as he chose. He was
left-handed, too. But against this, there was old Rollo’s
statement, evidently made in good faith.</p>

<p>Eileen Cressage came into the room as he reached
this point in his cogitation. She sat down beside
him, and he hastened to clear up an item which had
occurred to him.</p>

<p>“Had young Dangerfield sprained his ankle
before he left here with you that morning?”</p>

<p>“No. He was all right. He sprained it in
London, somehow—getting out of the way of a taxi,
I think he said.”</p>

<p>“Funny thing to happen, surely?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he slipped on the kerb-stone, or something
like that.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger’s half-formulated idea broke down.
It was quite evident that Eric had not got his injury
in connection with the theft of the Talisman. It was
not a case of his having been half-caught in the
man-trap. Probably there was no man-trap at all.
Rollo had denied its existence, and one could take
Rollo’s word for things. At any rate, Westenhanger
felt he had given every possibility a fair
examination.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton came into the room, and
Westenhanger glanced up as she entered. Freddie
broke out at once.</p>

<p>“Heard the latest, Mrs. Caistor Scorton? The
Talisman’s come back!”</p>

<p>Westenhanger had his eyes on Mrs. Caistor
Scorton’s face as Freddie spoke; and he was amazed
to see the effect of the words. Incredulity,
stupefaction, and fear, swept in succession over her
features almost in an instant. Then she regained
command of herself, her thin lips tightened, and
she walked to her place without showing any further
sign of emotion. Only Westenhanger and Freddie
seemed to have noticed anything abnormal, so
quickly had she recovered her self-control. The
other members of the party had not looked up as
she came into the room.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got something,” Westenhanger
commented inwardly. “That shot took her absolutely
off her guard. She knows something about the
business—anyone can see that. She was
absolutely taken aback by Freddie. She’ll want to know
all about it, and then perhaps she’ll have to do
something. If we can only keep an eye on her through
to-day we may get to the bottom of the business at
last.”</p>

<p>He dawdled through his breakfast, lending an ear
to Freddie’s repetition of the tale of the Talisman’s
return. Mrs. Caistor Scorton listened eagerly, he
could see, and her breakfast remained almost
untouched. Westenhanger learned nothing further.
When Eileen rose from the table he accompanied
her out of the room.</p>

<p>“You’re not doing anything important this
morning, are you?” he questioned in a low voice, as soon
as the door closed behind them.</p>

<p>“Nothing in particular.”</p>

<p>“I want you to put yourself in my hands, then.
Don’t ask questions, please. I wish you to be an
absolutely unbiassed witness, if anything turns up.
But keep your eyes open. I want you to pay special
attention to Mrs. Caistor Scorton to-day. It’s most
important. Watch everything she does closely, and
we’ll compare notes afterwards.”</p>

<p>He led her to some seats near the main entrance,
from which they had a view of the corridor, and
when they had ensconced themselves he began to
talk of indifferent matters, so as to give a semblance
of naturalness to their attitude. Very soon Mrs.
Caistor Scorton, accompanied by Freddie, came out
of the breakfast room and passed along the corridor
towards the Corinthian’s Room.</p>

<p>“Quick! I want to overtake them,” ordered
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>He and Eileen came up with the others just before
reaching the end of the passage. Westenhanger
stepped forward and opened the door, so that he
could see Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s face as she entered,
but he learned very little. She seemed to have
regained complete control of herself.</p>

<p>All four crossed the chess-board and approached
the cabinet. Freddie had made no mistake. There
on its velvet bed lay the Talisman, protected by the
bell of tinted glass which had been moved back to
its old position. Both doors of the cabinet were
closed. Everything seemed to have returned to its
normal state.</p>

<p>Westenhanger, covertly scrutinising Mrs. Caistor
Scorton’s face, saw a flash of expression which took
him by surprise. She seemed to be witnessing some
incredible happening—something beyond the bounds
of the possible. It almost suggested that she had
disbelieved Freddie and had been staggered by
the actual sight of the Talisman. In an instant
the signs of bewilderment vanished and she again
had herself under control. Freddie had evidently
noticed her amazement.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s come home again, all right,” he said,
triumphantly. “Old Dangerfield was sound enough,
after all. But how it got here is a mystery, isn’t
it, Mrs. Caistor Scorton?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” she admitted, dully, and
as she spoke she allowed her face to reveal the
stupefaction which was evidently still her dominant
feeling.</p>

<p>“Well I’m very glad to see it again,” said Eileen.
“It’s a relief to find that it wasn’t stolen after all.”</p>

<p>Her glance made Mrs. Caistor Scorton wince.
Neither of them had forgotten Mrs. Caistor
Scorton’s evidence against Eileen; and the older woman
evidently had little difficulty in reading the girl’s
feelings—she avoided any recognition of the
underlying meaning in Eileen’s last remark by turning to
Freddie Stickney.</p>

<p>“I really hardly believed your story at first, Mr.
Stickney; but one can’t disbelieve one’s eyes. It
seems incredible that it has come back again. I feel
almost inclined to doubt it even now.”</p>

<p>“We can soon settle that for you,” said Freddie.
“I’ll take it out of the case and you can handle it.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger broke in with a violence which
surprised them all.</p>

<p>“Paws off, Freddie! Don’t lay a finger on it!”</p>

<p>He laid a rough hand on Freddie’s shoulder and
drew him back from the cabinet. Then, noticing
their surprise, he went on in a milder tone.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dangerfield refused to allow any of us to
touch it, the night he showed it to us. He objects
to it being handled. That’s enough for me. We
can’t go against his wishes behind his back.
Understand?”</p>

<p>Freddie acquiesced sulkily. Mrs. Caistor Scorton
relieved the strain by looking at her watch and
discovering that she had something to do. As they
left the room, Westenhanger lagged behind with
Eileen for a moment.</p>

<p>“Keep her in sight at any cost. I’m going up
to my room for a moment. I’ll join you again.”</p>

<p>When he returned, he found Eileen standing at
the main entrance with Freddie Stickney. Mrs.
Caistor Scorton had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Shall we go now?” Westenhanger asked the girl.
She nodded and they shook off Freddie without
much difficulty. He supposed they were going to
play tennis. Eileen led the way down into the
gardens.</p>

<p>“She went off almost as soon as you went
upstairs,” she told Westenhanger, as they hurried
along. “I stood at the door and watched the road
she took. We ought to make up on her in a moment
or two if we hurry.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to make up on her. I want to
follow her without showing ourselves. She’s making
for the Pool, if I’m not mistaken. That will suit
very well.”</p>

<p>He took a pair of prismatic glasses from his pocket
and slung them round his neck.</p>

<p>“We may want to watch from a distance. That’s
why I had to go upstairs for these.”</p>

<p>Eileen nodded.</p>

<p>“It’s the Talisman affair, isn’t it?” she asked.
“I don’t quite see what it all means, but you know
something, obviously. Why are we scurrying after
her just now? The Talisman’s back again. I don’t
see what you expect to find out.”</p>

<p>“No questions, Eileen!” Westenhanger smiled.
“If I’m right, you’ll see it all in a few minutes. I
don’t want to put any pre-conceived notions into
your mind.”</p>

<p>The girl studied his face in silence as they walked
on.
“Very well,” she said. “But to tell you the truth
I’m getting rather wearied of Talisman mysteries.
It seems to me I’ve had more than my share of
them.”</p>

<p>“This will be the last of them, perhaps, if we’re
lucky.”</p>

<p>As he spoke they drew near the edge of the spinney
which lay about the Pool, and he made a gesture of
caution to the girl. They could see Mrs. Caistor
Scorton’s figure crossing the open glade in front of
them.</p>

<p>“Now watch with all your eyes,” ordered
Westenhanger, lifting his glasses as he spoke.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton glanced round nervously
once or twice; then, apparently satisfied that there
were no onlookers, she made her way to a pollard
willow which overhung the water. Still on the alert,
she put her hand far down into a hollow in the
tree-trunk and drew out something. It was too far off
for Eileen to see more than the movement, but
Westenhanger whispered a running description of
what his glasses showed him.</p>

<p>“She’s taken something from the hole. . . . It’s
very small. . . . I can hardly make it out. Gold,
apparently, by the glint. . . . Now she’s putting her
hand in again . . . Something bigger this time . . .
Yes . . . Your silver mirror. . . . It’s tarnished a
bit, I’m afraid. . . . Now for it. She’s trying
again. . . .”</p>

<p>His tone showed a sharp disappointment.</p>

<p>“It looks like a silver-mounted paper-knife. . . .
Yes, that’s it. . . . Ah! I thought so. She’s got
more in that hoard of hers. . . . Something
moderate-sized this time. . . . Confound it! She’s turned
away from us. I can’t see it. . . . Now she’s
putting them all back again. Quick, Eileen! Back
along the path and get in among the bushes. Hide!
As quick as you can. Don’t make a sound.”</p>

<p>They managed to conceal themselves before Mrs.
Caistor Scorton came back into the belt of trees;
and from behind the bushes they watched her go
past. Believing herself alone, she took no thought
for her expression; and on her face they read the
utmost bewilderment, faintly tinged with fear.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t spotted it,” Westenhanger thought to
himself. “She ought to have done. But I expect
she’s completely jarred up. Well, this is the end
of her little game.”</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Caistor Scorton had disappeared
Westenhanger came out of his concealment and
beckoned Eileen back to the path.</p>

<p>“Now that the coast’s clear,” he said, “we can
have a look at the magpie’s hoard. No questions
yet!” he added, as she began to frame one. “Facts,
first of all; and you can draw your own conclusions.”</p>

<p>They went down to the tree; and Westenhanger
soon found the hollow which Mrs. Caistor Scorton
had used as her cache. Putting his hand into it, he
drew out in succession the articles which he had seen
through his glasses.</p>

<p>“There’s Mrs. Brent’s wrist-watch,” he said,
holding up his first trophy. “No! Don’t touch it!
I’ll lay it on the grass.”</p>

<p>Again he put his hand into the hollow. The
second object gave him more trouble, but at last he
managed to humour it up the channel in the tree
trunk.</p>

<p>“Your mirror. What a pity it’s in such a state!
No permanent damage done, though. It’ll clean
up all right. You can have that.”</p>

<p>He handed it to her and re-inserted his hand into
the hole.</p>

<p>“The paper-knife. Don’t touch!”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the one that used to be on the library
table.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” said Westenhanger. “Now for the star
piece of the collection.”</p>

<p>He drew out the fourth object, and at the sight
of it Eileen exclaimed in astonishment:</p>

<p>“The Talisman! This is impossible, Conway!
We left the Talisman safe in the house not a quarter
of an hour ago. She can’t have stolen it a second
time.”</p>

<p>She put out her hand for the armlet, but
Westenhanger sharply drew it back out of her reach.</p>

<p>“Paws off, Eileen, as I remarked to Freddie not
so long ago. Under no circumstances whatever are
you to touch this thing until I give you
permission.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it, then. I won’t finger it.”</p>

<p>He held it out for her inspection and she
examined it minutely.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> the Talisman!”</p>

<p>She thought for a time, while Westenhanger
watched her in silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, now I see it, I think. There are two
Talismans? Or there’s a Talisman and a replica. Mrs.
Caistor Scorton stole this one. The other one’s up
at the house now. She must have got a shock when
she heard the Talisman had come back again. Is
that it?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger’s reply seemed irrelevant.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s not a very clever person
like you.”</p>

<p>“Ah! now I see what it means. She stole this
one; and when she saw the other one in the case
she was absolutely puzzled. She never thought of
a replica. And so she thought she’d come up against
magic and spells. Is that it? No wonder she was
so staggered. I was completely puzzled myself for
a moment or two, and I expect her conscience—if
she has one—must have upset her a bit.”</p>

<p>“That’s how I explain it myself,” said
Westenhanger. “But proceed. What else do you make of
it?”</p>

<p>The girl considered for a time; then at last she
hit on a solution.</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s obvious when one puts two and
two together. The Dangerfields never kept the
Talisman in the cabinet at all. They had a replica
for show and they kept the real Talisman in a safe
place.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Westenhanger, “and that would
account for the bell of tinted glass. The tinge would
conceal the fact that the stones in this thing are
paste. Even an expert couldn’t see anything wrong
with the water of them, if he looked through that
dingy cover.”</p>

<p>“You think that’s why Mr. Dangerfield wouldn’t
allow it to be taken out of the cabinet?”</p>

<p>“Quite probably.”</p>

<p>“And that’s why he has been so easy-going over
the whole thing? He didn’t stand to lose
much—only a piece of sham jewellery.”</p>

<p>“Obviously correct, I think. ‘It’s very clever of
you to have noticed it,’ as you once said to me.”</p>

<p>Eileen laughed.</p>

<p>“How you seem to treasure my sayings!”</p>

<p>She examined the armlet again.</p>

<p>“So this is the thing that brought me into all
that trouble. And it’s only a sham after all! By
the way, didn’t Mr. Dangerfield say something rather
bitter about the original Talisman that night he told
us the legend? Something about it’s being a sham
and a fraud from the very start?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t quite that. He said it was a memorial
of lying and cheating.”</p>

<p>“It seems an unpleasant sort of thing altogether.
We’d better get it off our hands, I think. What are
you going to do with it now?”</p>

<p>“Take it up to the house again. But that reminds
me, you’re still under the law of ‘No Questions.’
Everything shall be cleared up to your satisfaction
in a very short time, if you’ll only wait.”</p>

<p>He wrapped the armlet carefully in his
handkerchief and dropped it into his pocket, taking care to
touch it as little as he could. The wrist-watch and
paper-knife he put into his breast-pocket with less
precaution.</p>

<p>“Now for the next act!”</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” pleaded Eileen. “Just one
question. Why did Mr. Dangerfield put out the real
Talisman this morning?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger had his answer ready.</p>

<p>“What happened? The thief got a nasty jar. I
expect that was what he intended to do. He may
have been on the look-out as well as ourselves.”</p>

<p>They made their way up to the house. On the
road they met Eric Dangerfield walking slowly.</p>

<p>“Seen Mrs. Caistor Scorton?” asked
Westenhanger, casually. “She was just in front of us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Eric. “She’s gone up to the
house.”</p>

<p>He walked on and they hurried forward towards
Friocksheim.</p>

<p>“She’s gone to have another look at the cabinet,
I expect,” said Westenhanger. “Well, since she’s
in the house, we may as well strike while the iron’s
hot. I’ll not keep you on tenterhooks much longer.
As a matter of fact, there’s no more mystery in the
business.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XII</h2>

<p>At the door of Friocksheim, Westenhanger gave
Eileen his directions.</p>

<p>“I must get rid of these, first of all,” he explained,
tapping his binoculars. “While I’m upstairs, will
you go along to the Corinthian’s Room and wait for
me there? I shan’t be a minute.”</p>

<p>When he rejoined her, he had a brown paper parcel
in his hand, and from its shape she inferred that it
contained the stolen articles.</p>

<p>“Now we can get to business, Eileen.”</p>

<p>With a gesture, he invited her to come with him
to the cabinet of the Talisman, and to her
astonishment, he opened one of the doors and withdrew the
armlet from beneath the bell. Putting it aside with
a warning not to touch it, he took from his pocket
the replica which they had discovered in the hollow
tree; and this he placed on the velvet bed, arranging
it as nearly as possible in the position previously
occupied by its duplicate. He then covered it with the
bell and closed the door of the cabinet.</p>

<p>“Now the trap’s baited,” he said, putting the
second armlet in his pocket with no particular
precautions. “But we can’t risk the chance of a fresh
mouse nibbling the cheese before we’re ready. I’ll
have to stay here on guard. Your business will be
to go off, now, and collect all the people you can.
It doesn’t much matter who they are, so long as
Mrs. Caistor Scorton’s one of them. Bring half a
dozen at least. Tell them anything you like to get
them here. I’ll guarantee to keep them, once they
arrive.”</p>

<p>Eileen went off on her errand without venturing
to put the question which obviously was trembling
on her lips. Westenhanger sat down to await the
arrival of his audience.</p>

<p>The first to appear were Mrs. Brent and Wraxall.
Mrs. Brent was plainly rather mistrustful.</p>

<p>“Is this another of these peculiarly unsatisfactory
general meetings, Mr. Westenhanger? I hardly
expected to find you issuing invitations of the kind.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t my messenger reassure you?” countered
Westenhanger, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope my character’s not going to be
dissected this time,” she retorted tartly. “If I’m
dragged into it in any form, I warn you I shall
simply go away.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger’s amusement grew more apparent.</p>

<p>“Don’t make too rash promises,” he advised. “I
don’t think you’ll ask for your money back at the
door if you manage to sit through the first act. This
play gets brighter as it progresses.”</p>

<p>Wraxall looked at Westenhanger quizzically.</p>

<p>“What particular brand of drama do you
specialise in? Is it tragedy? Tragedy’s hardly my line.
Nor yet is sob-stuff. I don’t seem to react much to
sob-stuff. Or are you a Happy-Ender? I’d rather
you were. It’s preferable. I don’t care about
having an attack of catawampus as the curtain flips
down.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hear your criticisms afterwards,”
Westenhanger said lightly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton entered the room, but it was
evident that she would have stayed away had she
dared to do so. It was a very different Mrs. Caistor
Scorton from the one who had so calmly given her
damning evidence against Eileen a few nights earlier.
An air of bewilderment was still on her face; and
Westenhanger saw that she was puzzled by his
summons and uncertain as to its meaning. Quite
obviously she was afraid, and afraid of something which
she could not define even to herself. She walked
across the room and seated herself with her back to
the light. Westenhanger avoided looking in her
direction.</p>

<p>“Just as I thought,” he reflected. “She has no
notion that she’s been spotted; but the general
complexity of the affair is giving her the jumps. She’ll
brazen it out if she can, when it comes to the pinch.
Lucky I was careful.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield followed close on Mrs. Caistor
Scorton’s heels. As he entered, he shot a glance at
Westenhanger from under his white eyebrows, a
glance in which doubt seemed to mingle with a
certain hostility.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t like being dragged into this affair,”
was Westenhanger’s interpretation. “I suppose it
jars on his notions about the code of a host. I can’t
help his troubles, though. He’s got to go through
it with the rest. We must get rid of that woman
to-day, and he ought to be put on his guard in case
he ever thinks of bringing her down to Friocksheim
again.”</p>

<p>Freddie Stickney lounged into the room a few
minutes later. At the sight of the assembly, his
eyebrows rose momentarily and he glanced
inquisitively from one to another as though he hoped to
discover from the faces the secret of the meeting.
Westenhanger curtly invited him to sit down. He
augured little good from Freddie’s presence, and was
inclined to blame Eileen for having dragged the
creature into the affair at all. But then, remembering
that she probably wanted Freddie to see the final
clearing-up of the affair, so as to leave him no chance
for tittle-tattle, Westenhanger had to admit to
himself that she was right in her choice.</p>

<p>Almost at once, Eileen and Cynthia came through
the door together. Cynthia looked round the room
in some surprise. Eileen had evidently brought her
there without explanation.</p>

<p>“Who’s in the chair this time?” she inquired
languidly, when she had inspected the company.
“You, Mr. Westenhanger? Well, that’s a relief!”</p>

<p>She and Eileen chose seats near Mrs. Brent. The
gathering now seemed complete, and Westenhanger
was about to begin, when the door opened again.
Eric Dangerfield came into the room. It was
evident that he had not been summoned like the others,
and that he had no idea of what was afoot. He
seemed wrapped in a brown study, for when he raised
his head and caught sight of the company, he was
obviously surprised. He made no comment,
however; but Westenhanger saw him glance swiftly
round the group until he picked out his uncle.
Eric’s face was glum, and the message which his
eyes telegraphed was evidently unsatisfactory,
whatever its purport. Old Rollo’s expression showed
that the silent communication had taken him
completely aback. Incredulity, followed by something
like dismay, flashed for an instant across his features
before being effaced by the return of the old man’s
normal expression of aloofness. Westenhanger was
at a loss how to interpret the incident. Eric, having
delivered his message to his uncle, looked again at
the company and then seated himself in the nearest
vacant chair. He seemed to be brooding over some
problem which puzzled him, and he appeared to pay
little attention to Westenhanger’s opening words.</p>

<p>“I think we’re all rather <i>blasé</i> of these meetings,
by now,” Westenhanger began. “It’ll be a relief to
you to know that this one is positively the last.
Most of us have had evidence of sorts dragged out
of us on one pretence or another. It seems a pity
to be out of the fashion, so I’ll give you mine. And
that will finish the business.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton shifted slightly in her chair;
but Westenhanger could make nothing of her face.
If anything, she seemed more bewildered than ever.</p>

<p>“As you know,” Westenhanger continued, “I was
away from Friocksheim on the night of the
Talisman’s disappearance. I’ve nothing fresh to say
about that. Not to drag things out, I have
suspicions”—he dragged out his words slowly—“which
amount to . . . almost . . . a certainty . . . with
regard to the disappearance of the Talisman.”</p>

<p>To avoid glancing at any particular person, he
fixed his eyes on the tapestry of Diana’s hunting, as
though that chase engrossed his whole visual
attention for the moment.</p>

<p>“Somebody suggested that this business has been
a mere practical joke,” he continued. “If so, then
this is the last chance for the perpetrator of it to
own up. Anybody volunteer?”</p>

<p>Nobody accepted his offer. At last Freddie
Stickney broke the silence.</p>

<p>“Anyone can see it’s a practical joke. There’s
the Talisman staring you in the face! It’s not been
stolen at all.”</p>

<p>“Think so, Freddie? Perhaps you’re right. But
some other things have gone amissing: Miss
Cressage’s mirror, Mrs. Brent’s wrist-watch, and”—he
glanced at Eric for confirmation—“a silver-mounted
paper-knife from the library table.”</p>

<p>Eric nodded his confirmation of this. He was
paying more attention to Westenhanger now.</p>

<p>“There’s no question of a practical joke in these
cases, for the articles have not been returned.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t prove anything about the
Talisman,” Freddie objected with an air of acuteness.
“It was returned; they weren’t. Obviously the cases
are different.”</p>

<p>“If you insist on their reappearance,” answered
Westenhanger, “it’s easy enough to gratify you.”</p>

<p>He unwrapped his paper parcel and took out its
contents one by one.</p>

<p>“Your wrist-watch, Mrs. Brent? No, don’t touch
it, if you please. And Miss Cressage’s mirror. And
the paper-knife with the silver handle, which most
of us know well enough.”</p>

<p>Eileen was surprised to find that he had not
included the Talisman in the series.</p>

<p>As he drew out article after article, Westenhanger
had shot a sidelong glance at Mrs. Caistor Scorton.
With the appearance of the stolen goods, her figure
had grown rigid, and her face now showed fear as its
dominant note. She waited breathlessly for
Westenhanger’s next move.</p>

<p>“These things,” Westenhanger went on, “I
recovered this morning from the place where they had
been hidden.”</p>

<p>His eyes happened to light on Eric’s face as he
spoke, and he noticed an expression flit across it as
though this evidence had cleared up something. But
immediately perplexity reappeared in Eric’s features.
A fresh point seemed to have arisen to puzzle him.</p>

<p>Westenhanger refrained from dragging out the
agony.</p>

<p>“The thief was Mrs. Caistor Scorton,” he said,
bluntly.</p>

<p>At the words, Mrs. Caistor Scorton rose from her
chair.</p>

<p>“Mr. Westenhanger is very free with his
insinuations,” she commented. “So far, he has produced
nothing to support that lie.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger turned on her.</p>

<p>“These things were stolen from various places in
the house. This morning, Miss Cressage and I
watched you take them from the hollow tree down
by the Pool. I think that’s clear enough.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s simply your evidence against mine.
Miss Cressage doesn’t count, I’m afraid. She was
under suspicion herself not so long ago.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger went white with anger.</p>

<p>“Miss Cressage cleared herself of any charge that
you brought against her. But you’re mistaken if
you think the thing rests solely on that evidence.
The thief was left-handed; so are you.”</p>

<p>“So are other people.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger admitted this with a curt nod. He
had tried to drive her into an acknowledgment
without using the Talisman; but there seemed to be no
way out of it.</p>

<p>“It’s no use bluffing, Mrs. Scorton. Your
finger-prints are on the Talisman.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield interrupted him sharply.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken there, Mr. Westenhanger.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger stepped over to Rollo’s side and
lowered his voice so that only the old man could hear.</p>

<p>“Take my word for it. I’m afraid I’ve stumbled
on the Dangerfield Secret, and I’d rather say nothing
to put other people on the track.”</p>

<p>Rollo could take a blow without wincing. Apart
from the dismay in his eyes, he showed nothing to
mark that he had been touched on his most
sensitive spot.</p>

<p>“Very well, Mr. Westenhanger. Do as you please.
And thanks for your restraint.”</p>

<p>He raised his voice and spoke to the company at
large.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry that I inadvertently threw doubt on
Mr. Westenhanger’s statement. He knows best.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger pressed his point.</p>

<p>“Do you deny that your finger-prints are there?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton had seized on Rollo’s
intervention as a possible way opening to safety; but
with his recantation she seemed to lose heart
completely.</p>

<p>“Well, I took it, then,” she admitted. “I couldn’t
help it. I’m a kleptomaniac. I can’t help taking
glittering things like these. I’m not a thief. I don’t
steal for money. I don’t need money. It’s simply
I can’t help taking some things. They fascinate
me. I simply have to take them. I’ve fought
against it, but it’s no good.”</p>

<p>“So I thought,” said Westenhanger. “But that
hardly excuses the way in which you tried to throw
suspicion on other people. If you hadn’t done that,
it might have been possible to hush this up. But
you made it impossible to stop short of complete
exposure. I gave you every chance.”</p>

<p>“Need we go any further?” interposed old Rollo.
“I think the matter is now quite clear to all of us;
and I’m quite sure none of us wish it to go any
further. The main thing is that suspicion has been
cleared away.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger agreed.</p>

<p>“You’ve got off lightly, Mrs. Scorton. And you’ve
Mr. Dangerfield to thank for it. If the police had
been called in . . .”</p>

<p>Mrs. Caistor Scorton made no response. Nothing
which she could have said would have lessened her
defeat or gained her any sympathy. Westenhanger
had put his finger on the main point of her offence
when he spoke of her attempt to throw the blame
on other shoulders: kleptomania might be forgiven
as a morbid effect, but her effort to shield herself at
Eileen’s expense had put her in an even worse light.
Without a look at anyone, she crossed the room,
fumbled with the door-handle for an instant before
Westenhanger could come to her assistance, and
then went out.</p>

<p>With her departure, a sudden slackening of the
tension made itself felt. Everyone seemed anxious
to minimise the whole matter as far as possible. The
third uncomfortable scene of the week was at last
safely behind them, and obviously, as Westenhanger
had predicted, it would be the last of the series.
Friocksheim could get back to normal once more
now that the cloud of suspicion had settled finally
on the right person. In a few minutes
Westenhanger’s audience had filtered from the room, leaving
him alone with Eric and old Rollo.</p>

<p>As soon as the last outsider had gone,
Westenhanger put his hand in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Here’s the real Talisman,” he said, handing it
over to the old man. “Before staging that last affair
I exchanged it for the replica which Mrs. Caistor
Scorton took, so that I could prove the thing by
means of her finger-prints if necessary, and yet keep
the rest of them from knowing that you were using
a duplicate. I didn’t wish to let outsiders into a
secret which I’d stumbled upon myself by accident.”</p>

<p>“Very thoughtful of you,” Rollo said warmly.
“Most people would have been less careful of our
feelings, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger remembered something.</p>

<p>“Of course Miss Cressage knows the state of affairs
as well as I do; but you can trust her to keep other
people’s secrets. She’s proved that already at
considerable cost.”</p>

<p>“Oh, one could trust Miss Cressage completely, I
know.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger took a chair, as though to show
that he had more to say. Rollo Dangerfield, after
placing the Talisman in the little safe in the wall,
sat down in his turn. Eric took up his position in
front of the fire-place.</p>

<p>“I’m not quite clear about the whole of this
business,” said Westenhanger to his host. “Perhaps,
since I’ve blundered so far into it—unintentionally—you
won’t mind settling one or two points for me.”</p>

<p>Again he noted with surprise that an expression of
dismay seemed to flicker for an instant in Rollo’s
face. “Now what on earth is he jumpy about, at
this stage in the affair?” Westenhanger asked
himself; but he could find no immediate answer to the
question.</p>

<p>Rollo merely nodded in response to his guest’s
remark. He evidently intended to answer or not as
suited him best.</p>

<p>“What has puzzled me, for one thing,”
Westenhanger continued, “is why you have been using a
replica at all. Why not put the Talisman in a place
of safety and be done with it?”</p>

<p>“Did you never think of a stalking-horse?” Rollo
asked. “If we locked up the Talisman, then
anyone who wished to steal it would concentrate his
efforts on the thing itself, and we should have to
take precautions. As it is—you’ve seen the process
in operation yourself—the thief thinks it is all plain
sailing. He concentrates on the sham Talisman and
never thinks of anything else. If he’s successful—it
matters very little to us. All he gets is some
gilded lead and a few bits of cheap paste.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” Westenhanger
admitted. “It’s certainly a sound piece of tactics.
But doesn’t the secret leak out if the thing happens
to be stolen?”</p>

<p>“No,” explained Rollo. “Suppose a thief takes
the replica—it’s been stolen oftener than we say in
public—what does he do? He can’t publish his
information. Nobody learns anything about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, of course, when one thinks of it,”
Westenhanger admitted, dismissing the matter.
“Now there’s another point that puzzled me. Why
did you suddenly put the Talisman back into the
cabinet last night?”</p>

<p>This time it was Eric who took the matter up.</p>

<p>“Look at the position from our point of view,
Westenhanger. The thing was stolen in the small
hours, that morning. I was round the house in the
earlier part of the night, watching to see that Helga
came to no harm. By the way, Douglas saw me
writing a note to Morchard, enclosing a cheque for
my losses; and I think Wraxall must have seen me
leaving it in the hall for Morchard to get in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“You seem to know a lot of details,” commented
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“Freddie Stickney has his uses,” Eric explained.
“He gave my uncle a full and embroidered account
of all that went on at that inquiry of his. Well,
we come to the next morning. Of course my uncle
and I went straight to the cabinet; and at once I
knew the thing had been stolen by a left-handed
person. It was obvious to me, because I’m
left-handed myself, as you know.”</p>

<p>He smiled ironically.</p>

<p>“You and Douglas were very ingenious,
Westenhanger; but as my own mind was running on parallel
lines, I hadn’t much trouble in seeing what you were
after with your coin-counting and all the rest of it.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger felt the home-thrust; but Eric
seemed to attach no importance to the matter.</p>

<p>“I had to go up to town that morning to pay in
a cheque to meet the one I’d given to Morchard,
before he could present it. Same case as Miss
Cressage, in fact. So we decided to postpone
investigation till I got back in the afternoon. As you know,
I got scuppered in town—twisted my ankle—and
couldn’t get back for a day or two. My uncle didn’t
make much of a success at the sleuth business. He
was quite content to wait till I turned up again and
picked out the missing left-hander. You see, we
had a pull over you people in the fact that I’m
left-handed myself, and so I know the finer points in
which a left-hander differs from the normal. We
had Mrs. Caistor Scorton picked out in a very short
time after I came home again—a much shorter time
than you took over the business, naturally, owing
to our handicap of special knowledge.”</p>

<p>He sat down and began to fill his pipe.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, of course,” he went on, “Freddie had
muddled things up no end by his pranks. But Mrs.
Brent had cleared Miss Cressage the night I came
home again, so that matter didn’t affect us. My
uncle had been carrying on his part of the show in
my absence—producing an atmosphere, if you see
what I mean. All that stuff about the Talisman
always coming back—of course, it always does come
back!—and so forth. That was all meant for Mrs.
Caistor Scorton’s benefit. We wanted to get her
into a state of uncertainty—general jumps, in fact,
semi-eerie atmosphere, you know, no saying what’s
going to happen, and so forth. My uncle managed
that side of it, with special attention to her as soon
as I’d picked her out.”</p>

<p>It was evident that old Rollo was half-ashamed of
the part he had played. He said nothing, however,
and Eric went on.</p>

<p>“Once we were sure of our effect, we brought the
Talisman home again.”</p>

<p>He nodded in the direction of the cabinet.</p>

<p>“We took care that Freddie knew about it first
thing. He passed it on to Mrs. Caistor Scorton.
She’s not a brainy person, really; and she fell right
into the trap we had laid for her. Given her brand
of mind, we counted that she would go straight off
to where she had hidden the replica she had stolen;
and we had only to keep an eye on her. It worked
out quite according to plan. She lost her head when
she saw the thing over there. She must have thought
the world was upside-down or something. So off she
scuttled at once to see what had become of her
own Talisman. Mixed up with the general muddle
in her mind there was probably the fear that we
had found the thing and got it back. So away she
went, to make sure. That really seems to support
the kleptomania notion. No thief with any
constructive capacity would have dreamed of going to
his cache in these circumstances. As soon as she
left the house I was on the watch with a telescope
from my rooms in the tower up above here. You
can see every part of the place from there—bar the
belt of trees round the pool. You can see the Pool
itself, and I watched her go down there and examine
her hiding-place. As soon as she put the things back
again I went off as quick as I could limp to secure
them.”</p>

<p>“I remember we met you on the road.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I passed you and went right on to the
willow. You can guess how I felt when I put my
hand into the hole and found nothing there. I
hadn’t seen you and Miss Cressage through the
telescope, you know; you must have been hidden in the
belt of trees when I was on the watch; and you only
came out after I had come down from my post.”</p>

<p>“So that’s why you were looking puzzled when
you came in here?”</p>

<p>“Well, how would you have felt? It seemed a bit
weird to find the things gone, within a minute or
two of my seeing them put back into the hole.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you haven’t had all the laughs on your
side.”</p>

<p>“I came in here,” Eric continued, “just to see if
the cabinet was all right; and of course I plunged
into the middle of your At Home. You certainly
took a nasty bit of work off our hands by your
intervention. Well, I think that’s all. Virtue rewarded,
and all that—just like a fairy tale, eh?”</p>

<p>“It’s been a thoroughly unpleasant business,” old
Rollo spoke at last. “There’s only one thing in it
that gives me any satisfaction. It was our good
fortune that the only people who fathomed the secret
of the replica are you, Mr. Westenhanger, and Miss
Cressage. We know that the matter is safe in your
keeping.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Caistor Scorton must have some suspicions,
surely?” Westenhanger suggested.</p>

<p>“Suspicions, yes,” admitted the old man, grimly.
“But I think she’s hardly likely to mention the
Talisman to anyone in future. She won’t betray much.”</p>

<p>“So that’s why you wouldn’t call in the police?”
demanded Westenhanger. “I must confess that
puzzled me badly. I began to believe you really thought
yourself that the Talisman would come back of its
own accord.”</p>

<p>Rollo avoided answering the question.</p>

<p>“You may tell Miss Cressage exactly what you
think fit about all this,” he said. “Perhaps she
ought to know the whole facts. We can trust her
implicitly. We all know that.”</p>

<p>“Well, Friocksheim will be a bit more comfortable
to live in, now, or I’m mistaken,” Eric said hopefully
as they left the room. “We’ll be three short at
dinner to-night, no doubt; but I expect we’ll bear up
under the loss.”</p>

<p>“Three?” queried Westenhanger.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Scorton’s hardly likely to stay. Then
Morchard was only down here trying to persuade us to
sell him Friocksheim. Nothing doing, of course;
we’d as soon think of parting with the Talisman
itself. After what’s happened, we shan’t press him
to prolong his visit. He’s not a friend of ours, it
was merely a matter of business.”</p>

<p>“I wondered how he came to be here at all,”
confessed Westenhanger. “He seemed a bit out of his
element. And who’s the third?”</p>

<p>“Freddie. I have an idea that my uncle will
politely but firmly hasten his departure. He’s
stirred up enough trouble to last us for a while, and
we’ll be happier without him.”</p>

<p>As it turned out, Eric was accurate in his
forecasts. Mrs. Caistor Scorton took her departure in
the afternoon, without meeting anyone, and by the
same train went Morchard and Freddie Stickney.</p>

<p>“Must have been an interesting scene at the
station,” speculated Douglas Fairmile as he joined
Wraxall and Westenhanger in the evening, after most
of the others had gone to bed. “The good lady
would hustle into her compartment first of all. Seat
facing the engine, no doubt. In her state of mind
it would be better to look forward than to look
back. Bury the past! Then friend Morchard
would hop into a smoker. And Freddie would be
left on the platform, wondering which of them he’d
most like to worry with his company up to town.
He’s not the lad to feel himself <i>de trop</i> anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Let’s forget ’em,” suggested Westenhanger.
“They gave us enough trouble between them. I can
feel the air of the place different, since they’ve gone.”</p>

<p>“So can I,” confirmed the American. “It’s been
a very awkward week for all of us; and it’s been
specially awkward for me, if I may say so. I was
the outsider in the party. Your English hospitality’s
perfect, and you couldn’t have done more to make
me feel at home. But all the same, I was the one
visitor that none of you knew personally before we
met here. And I was the only one, bar the
Dangerfields, who had a direct interest in the Talisman. I
wanted the thing badly. The Dangerfields knew
that quite well; I’d even made an offer for it, the
very night it was stolen. Old Mr. Dangerfield put
that offer aside. Quite polite, of course; but you
know that uninterested way he has, as if he were
thinking of something else all the time. No good.
But I’d showed him how keen I was on the thing.”</p>

<p>He put down his cigar.</p>

<p>“And that very night, the thing disappeared!
Collectors have the name of being an unscrupulous
gang. I might have lifted it easily enough. And
next day I got a notion he suspected me. It was very
awkward. It was most awkward. And we’ve got
you to thank, Westenhanger, for getting us out of
it. I’m grateful. I’m very thankful to get my
character cleared.”</p>

<p>“But surely you didn’t expect to buy the
Talisman?” said Douglas. “The Dangerfields would
never part with the thing.”</p>

<p>“If you’re ever hard up, Fairmile, you’ll do a lot
of things you wouldn’t think of in your present state.
I reckoned it out this way. The Talisman is the
big Dangerfield asset. So long as they have it,
they’re all right. Their credit’s good. But money’s
more use to them than jewels just now. I have ways
of finding out things like that, and I banked on it.
My offer would have been a better spec. for them
than the Talisman itself, from the credit point of
view. I offered far more than the thing’s worth in
the open market—twenty-five per cent. more. But
it seems this family pride comes in. They won’t
part with the thing. I was struck by that. I
haven’t met that so strong before.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps your information’s wrong about their
finances. One would need to be in the last ditch
before one would think of selling a thing like the
Talisman. And I doubt if the Dangerfields are anywhere
near the last ditch.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re mistaken, Westenhanger.
That’s what made me so sure I was going to get the
thing. They’re right in that ditch now.”</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII</h2>

<p>Conway Westenhanger had never pretended, even
to himself, that he had a natural gift for detective
work. He had quite frankly recognised that only
good luck could bring him to success in his search
for the taker of the Talisman; and a retrospect over
the events of the week served merely to confirm the
idea. None the less, the history of the case caused
him to feel a touch of chagrin. While he had been
following out erroneous inductions, the two
Dangerfields had gone straight to the mark; and if he had
actually beaten them by a short head in the end, it
was by good luck and nothing else. In fact, he had
profited by their manœuvres in the matter of the
Talisman’s return. Without that incident, he would
have been unable to discover anything at all.</p>

<p>Now, so far as he was concerned, the episode
seemed to have reached its end, but when he thought
over the whole affair, one point still remained a
mystery to him. Why had old Rollo shown that
touch of dismay at a reference to the Dangerfield
Secret? The thing had been only momentary, but it
had been unmistakable, and Westenhanger had seen
it twice over within a very short period. The first
time, he recalled, was when he had hinted to Rollo
that he had stumbled on the Secret; the second
occasion was when he had shown signs of asking
questions which, possibly, might touch the same subject.</p>

<p>“Is this Secret of theirs merely the use of the
replica as a stalking-horse, to mask the real
Talisman?” Westenhanger asked himself.</p>

<p>But a moment’s reflection showed him that this
explanation would not cover the facts.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t that. Old Rollo knew I’d tumbled
to their use of the replica. That was what startled
him the first time. But it was some time after that,
when I began asking questions to clear the affair
up, that he got really worried. He couldn’t have
been troubled about his stalking-horse then, because
obviously I knew all about it already. But he was
quite evidently afraid I was getting near something.
Ergo, the replica affair isn’t the real Dangerfield
Secret at all. There’s something further, behind all
this. And it must be something pretty big, too;
for Rollo Dangerfield isn’t a person one could easily
jar off the rails.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger hated to be puzzled. A problem
worried him, until he could get at its solution. And
this affair at Friocksheim had given him more
anxiety than he had expected, when he had first gone
light-heartedly to Freddie Stickney’s inquiry. Then,
he had been in a completely detached position, the
one person who could not come under suspicion.
But the outcome of Freddie’s operations had been to
drag Westenhanger into the business on behalf of
Eileen Cressage; and from that he had gone further
in his attempt to clear up the whole affair and fix the
blame on the right shoulders. And now, something
seemed to lead him another step on the road; a fresh
mystery confronted him, obscure and tantalising by
its very vagueness.</p>

<p>With an effort he put it to the back of his mind.</p>

<p>“It’s no affair of mine,” he repeated to himself
again and again.</p>

<p>But even that truism failed to exorcise his demon.
Ever and again the Dangerfield Secret crept up out
of his mental background and insisted on forcing
itself upon his conscious thoughts, and with each
appearance it took on a slightly different and more
definite form. He gathered no fresh data, but things
which he knew already began to fit themselves
together in his mind, until at last, in a flash of
illumination, he seemed to see the whole puzzle
completed.</p>

<p>“So <em>that’s</em> the Dangerfield Secret!”</p>

<p>Then, as the fuller implications of the thing forced
themselves upon him:</p>

<p>“No wonder they were afraid. Poor devils!”</p>

<p>He ran over the evidence once more, and found
himself forced to believe that he had reached a
correct solution. Everything pointed in the same
direction. Not only so, but other things now fitted
themselves into the scheme, things which he had noticed
casually, and had not hitherto thought of, connecting
together. And then a further conjecture shot across
his mind, completing the whole history of the
Dangerfield Secret.</p>

<p>“That’s it, almost certainly,” he reflected.
“They’ve made nothing of it themselves, though
they’re cute enough. But I wonder . . .”</p>

<p>He paused, in doubt for a moment.</p>

<p>“It’s a very long shot; but a fresh mind often
sees a thing that other people overlook. Perhaps
one might lend them a hand. Luck’s been with me,
so far. Let’s press it while it lasts. If it’s a
wash-out there’s no harm done.”</p>

<p>His first step was to seek out Rollo
Dangerfield.</p>

<p>“Might I have another look at that peculiar
leather thing you showed us one night—the thing
your grandfather left?”</p>

<p>Rollo looked at him suspiciously, but complied
without any marked reluctance. They went together
to the Corinthian’s Room where Rollo opened the
safe.</p>

<p>“I’d like to have a glance at the chess-board
problem, too,” said Westenhanger, as though struck
by an after-thought. “I used to be rather keen on
these things, and I’d like to see if I could solve that
one.”</p>

<p>The old man put his hand into the safe and
withdrew the two objects. Westenhanger took them.</p>

<p>“I’ll copy this, if you don’t mind, and then you
can put them back into safety. I’d rather not be
responsible for them longer than’s necessary.”</p>

<p>He stepped over into the library, followed by
Rollo, and copied down the wording of the document
and the position of the chess-pieces under the old
man’s supervision. Then he took up the leather disc
and inspected it closely.</p>

<p>“I thought, perhaps, that it might have been a
leather washer for some mechanical contrivance,” he
said at last, handing the shrivelled object back to
its owner. “But now that I’ve seen it again, I don’t
believe it can have been that, after all. It’s certainly
been used for some purpose or other, for the surface
isn’t smooth on either side. Shoemaker’s leather
sheets always have one side semi-polished, if I’m
not mistaken.”</p>

<p>“What made you think of a washer?” inquired
Rollo, more from politeness than from interest, it
seemed.</p>

<p>“You mentioned that your grandfather took some
interest in mechanics—a bit of an inventor, I
gathered. So I thought possibly it might have some
connection with machinery. But when one looks
at it, I doubt if that’s a possible explanation. It
might be the washer of a pump-piston, of course, but
I shouldn’t think so. The hole in the centre’s only
big enough to take the twine. A piston-washer
would have a bigger hole in it. No, it beats me.”</p>

<p>Rollo took the thing back without comment.
Westenhanger passed him the paper also; and old
Dangerfield replaced them in the safe. He was
turning to leave the room when Westenhanger spoke
again.</p>

<p>“By the way, the Dangerfield Secret’s only three
generations old, isn’t it, Mr. Dangerfield?”</p>

<p>By the startled expression on Rollo’s face,
Westenhanger saw that he had hit the mark. The old man
was plainly astounded by the question. It was a
few moments before he replied.</p>

<p>“You’re somewhere near it,” he admitted, looking
distrustfully at the engineer. “How did you come
to hit on that particular period?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just a guess,” said Westenhanger, lightly.</p>

<p>Rollo seemed in doubt as to what he should say
next. Then evidently he felt it best to keep off a
subject which he seemed to think a dangerous one.</p>

<p>“If you find the key-move of that chess-problem,”
he said, changing the topic with obvious intention,
“you might make a note of it and tell me what it is.
We may as well enter it up in the archives.”</p>

<p>He smiled with little apparent amusement and left
Westenhanger to his self-imposed task. The
engineer plunged at once into the study of the
chess-position. Two minutes’ scrutiny satisfied him on
one point.</p>

<p>“That’s no normal chess problem,” he said to
himself. “If it’s White to play, he can checkmate
Black by simply taking that pawn with his bishop.
The old Corinthian evidently was an expert, from
what old Dangerfield told us; and no expert would
trouble to put down a thing like this on paper. And,
by the same reasoning, Rollo’s suggestion’s rubbish,
too. There could be no conceivable dispute over a
position of this sort. The merest beginner would see
at a glance that Black has lost the game. The
Corinthian would never have troubled to jot this down,
if that was all the matter at stake.”</p>

<p>He looked at the diagram disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Of course, if one were full up to the back-teeth
with port, it might look less obvious than it does.
I shan’t try the experiment, though. It’s quite on
the cards that he was completely dazed and didn’t
see the mate in one move. Let’s leave it at that just
now, and try the rest of the thing.”</p>

<p>He transferred his attention to the inscription
above the diagram.</p>

<p>“<i>Nox nocti indicat scientiam.</i> Night unto night
sheweth knowledge, it’s translated in the Bible, I
remember. That’s mysterious enough. I wonder
why he chose the Latin instead of the English
version. Perhaps he read the Vulgate and liked the
sound of the Latin. Now what about these two
texts: Matthew Sixth and Twenty-first; Luke
Twelfth and Thirty-fourth. There ought to be a
Bible somewhere on the shelves.”</p>

<p>He hunted for a time and at last discovered the
volume.</p>

<p>“Let’s see. ‘<i>For where thy treasure is, there will
thy heart be also.</i>’ And the other one: ‘<i>For where
your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</i>’ ”</p>

<p>He pondered over the texts for a time, but no
enlightenment came to him.</p>

<p>“All the same,” he assured himself at last, “these
two texts seem more to the point than the rest of
the stuff. I can’t help feeling I’m on the right track.
Suppose we put it all together and see if there’s
any traceable connection between the three links.”</p>

<p>He began at the top of the paper.</p>

<p>“<i>Nox</i>. Darkness. Black. Does that mean, by
any chance, that it’s Black’s turn to play and not
White’s?”</p>

<p>He mentally tried over the possible moves; but
they led to nothing.</p>

<p>“No good. A bit far-fetched, in any case. But
why use Latin in one text and English for the rest;
for the text-references are obviously to the English
Bible and not to the Vulgate—Luke isn’t Latin.
There might be something there, if one could only
see it.”</p>

<p>He stared at the paper as though hoping that some
key-word would flash up from the inscriptions.</p>

<p>“The fresh eye doesn’t seem to see much,” he
confessed ruefully, after a time. “I make neither
head nor tail of it. And yet I’m dead certain that
the thing’s there, if one could only get a glimpse of
it. What’s wanted is someone I could talk it over
with—one often gets a flash that way.”</p>

<p>A recollection of Rollo’s words passed through his
mind: “You may tell Miss Cressage what you
think fit. We can trust her.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger hesitated.</p>

<p>“It’s straining the meaning a bit further than old
Dangerfield meant, perhaps. But the principle’s the
main thing. She wouldn’t let anything slip out.
Besides, they’ve never taken me into their confidence.
I’m not giving away anything they’ve told me. So
why not?”</p>

<p>He folded up his paper, put it into his pocket, and
left the room. It took him some time to discover
Eileen, but at last he found her at the tennis-courts,
watching Douglas and Cynthia playing a single.</p>

<p>On the departure of the three pariahs, the
Friocksheim atmosphere had cleared, as the weather
changes after the passing of thunder. Sudden
relaxation of the long-drawn-out strain of suspicion
produced a reaction among the remaining company;
and the influence of Douglas Fairmile soon
supplanted the morbid inquisitiveness of Freddie
Stickney. Tacitly it was resolved to obliterate the whole
incident from memory, and to make the
house-party a success.</p>

<p>In this new medium Eileen Cressage had
undergone an almost visible change. Relieved from the
irritation of Freddie’s suspicions and freed from the
annoyance of Morchard’s presence, she had recovered
an enjoyment of life and high spirits which marked
how much she had been repressed under the weight
of mistrust. Westenhanger had been surprised to
find in her almost a new character.</p>

<p>“Care to walk down to the sea?” he asked, as he
came up to where she was sitting.</p>

<p>She sprang up at once and joined him.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to the headland again,” she suggested,
as they passed through the gardens. “I’d rather
like to sit there for a while.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Kestrel’s</i> still in the bay,” Westenhanger
reminded her. “You won’t have to sweep the
horizon for her smoke this time, thank goodness.”</p>

<p>“No. That’s over. And I suppose you won’t be
worried over puzzles about whether I’m right or
left-handed this time.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger took up the challenge, much to her
surprise.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that! I’ve got another
problem on hand now. Care to help?”</p>

<p>Eileen’s face clouded suddenly.</p>

<p>“Not more suspicion, surely? And I thought we’d
got rid of all that! Friocksheim’s been lovely, since
we put all that affair behind us. You’re not raking
it up again, are you?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger reassured her with a smile.</p>

<p>“No. That’s the last thing I’d want to do. You
know that quite well. This is a philanthropic effort,
if it’s anything.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, if it’s merely a case of helping
someone, I’ll be delighted to do anything.”</p>

<p>They had reached the headland, and he took a seat
by her side before saying more.</p>

<p>“It’s just a thing that’s puzzling me,” he explained.
“You remember Mr. Dangerfield showed us those
relics of the old Corinthian that night? I’ve had
another look at them, and I feel sure there’s
something behind the business. I’d like to talk it over
with you, just to see what you make of it. Of
course, we say nothing to anyone else about it—that’s
understood?”</p>

<p>Eileen nodded agreement.</p>

<p>“Go ahead then, Conway. But I shan’t be much
help, I know.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger pulled out his copy of the
Corinthian’s document.</p>

<p>“This is the thing. I feel sure that it’s the key
to something or other. The Dangerfields evidently
have made nothing of it, so I thought I’d try my
hand—or our hands—at it.”</p>

<p>Eileen took the paper from him and scanned it
for a moment.</p>

<p>“You’ve come to the wrong girl. I don’t know
Latin and I don’t play chess. What help could I
be?”</p>

<p>“Well, ask any questions you like. Perhaps
they’ll suggest something. That’s the way you can
help.”</p>

<p>Eileen looked again at the sheet in her hand.</p>

<p>“What does this Latin sentence mean, first of all?
I’ve forgotten what Mr. Dangerfield told us.”</p>

<p>“<i>Nox nocti indicat scientiam</i>? ‘One night gives
a tip to another night’ would be a colloquial
translation of it.”</p>

<p>The girl looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“But I thought it came from the Bible. I never
heard knights mentioned in the Bible. Are you sure
you’re right?”</p>

<p>It was Westenhanger’s turn to look blank.</p>

<p>“Your education’s been neglected. Didn’t it rain
for forty days and forty nights about the time of the
Deluge?”</p>

<p>Eileen’s face cleared.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see what you mean. I thought you meant
K-N-I-G-H-T when you said that one gave the other
a tip.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger’s excitement was obvious.</p>

<p>“I knew you’d throw some light on the thing!
That makes it clear enough. But who’d have
thought of a pun?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Look here, Eileen. ‘Night unto night sheweth
knowledge.’ That’s how it reads in English. These
horse-headed pieces on the chess-board are knights—with
a K. If the old Corinthian had put his text
into English, it would have been fairly obvious:
‘Night unto night’ . . . and two knights on the
board. So he used the Latin and concealed the
thing. It could only be understood if one
translated into English and took the sound of the words
as a guide instead of the spelling.”</p>

<p>“I think I see. So that really means that one
of these knights on the chess-board has something
to tell the other one? What is it he can tell? You
play chess; I don’t.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s not so easy as all that, Eileen. Chess doesn’t
help much here, so far as I can see. But suppose we
go up to the house and get a board and the pieces.
It’ll be easier to see then, perhaps. If anyone comes
across us, I’m teaching you chess, remember. We
don’t want this talked about.”</p>

<p>“Very good.” She rose to her feet. “Let’s go
now.”</p>

<p>They went up to the house and Westenhanger
unearthed a chess-board and men in the library.
Soon he had set up a duplicate of the diagram with
the pieces, and he and Eileen bent their heads
over it.</p>

<p>“Even if you don’t know chess, at least you know
what a knight’s move is: two squares on and then
one to the right or left. You can make the move in
any direction you please. Like this, or this.”</p>

<p>He illustrated it on the board.</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember that. It comes into puzzles and
things of that sort.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger thought for a short time without
saying anything.</p>

<p>“One knight gives a tip to the other,” he mused
at last. “There’s only one tip worth having in chess:
and that’s how to checkmate your opponent.”</p>

<p>He looked over the board once or twice.</p>

<p>“That’s it!” he exclaimed. “One of these knights
can mate the black king without the help of any other
piece if he moves this way.
One—two—three—four moves!”</p>

<p>He moved the white knight from the knight’s
square successively to the squares number 1, 2, 3,
and 4 in the diagram.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/diagram2.jpg" alt="The same chess-board diagram,
this time with four squared numbered to show the moves that one of the
White knights can make to put the Black king in checkmate.">
</figure>

<p>“That gives checkmate. Now let’s try the other
knight.”</p>

<p>He tried a move or two.</p>

<p>“This second knight can’t get a mate in four
moves by any chance. That looks all right, doesn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“You mean that the one knight could show the
other one how the thing ought to be done?”</p>

<p>“Something like that. A bit far-fetched, of
course; but so is the pun on the word knight—and
I’m sure we’re right about it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” demanded Eileen, eagerly. “What does
it lead to? Do you see what it means?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger made a gesture of negation.</p>

<p>“No. In itself it doesn’t mean anything to me.
We’ll need to guess again. I’m afraid I’ll have to
think it over for a time. At present it suggests
nothing to me.”</p>

<p>Eileen’s face showed her disappointment.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought we were just on the edge of finding
out something. What a nuisance.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger thoughtfully folded up his paper.
Then he replaced the chessmen in their box and put
the box and chess-board back into their proper
places.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go out and see if we can’t find
something else to do,” he suggested. “Sometimes a thing
occurs to one easier if one doesn’t think too hard
about it. Shall we take out one of the cars for an
hour or two?”</p>

<p>They left the library and passed into the
Corinthian’s Room. Westenhanger’s eye was caught by
the Chess-board on the pavement and his face
lighted up.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ve got it!” he exclaimed. “Didn’t
Mr. Dangerfield tell us that night, something about
the pieces being found in position on that
Chess-board?”</p>

<p>Eileen recalled the scene.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she confirmed. “He said that after the
duel they found the document on his desk and the
pieces in the same order on that big Chess-board.
You remember he suggested that it might be the end
of the game he and his friend had been playing.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger’s features showed the elation he
felt.</p>

<p>“Well, I believe we’ve stumbled right on the
solution. Our luck’s holding, after all; for it was pure
luck that I happened to look at that Chess-board as
we passed. I’d forgotten about the thing—or at
least I hadn’t thought about it in that connection.
But when my eye caught the board I remembered
something else.”</p>

<p>He knelt down and scrutinised the corners of one
or two squares.</p>

<p>“Yes, they are oil-holes right enough. I was sure
they were, the first time I saw them, but I couldn’t
make out what they were there for. They’re all
stopped up with dirt. We’ll need a fine wire and a
bottle of oil. Probably the whole affair’s rusted up
with age; for it can’t have been working for years
and years.”</p>

<p>Eileen’s eyes shone with excitement.</p>

<p>“You really think you’ve got to the bottom of it?
Let’s go at once and get the oil and the wire and
whatever else you need. I do want to see you clear
the thing up. This last bit sounds exciting.”</p>

<p>“It may be all wrong, you know,” Westenhanger
warned her. “Don’t imagine we’re out of the wood
yet.”</p>

<p>“What do you think you’re going to find out?
The Dangerfield Secret?”</p>

<p>“If this turns up trump,” said Westenhanger,
“you and I will know more about the Dangerfield
Secret than the Dangerfields themselves do. I’m
pretty sure of that, at any rate. But there’s an ‘if’
with a capital ‘I’ in it yet; so don’t expect too much.
It’s quite on the cards that we’re on a wild-goose
chase with a mare’s nest at the end of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, do let’s get the things you need and start
as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger had little difficulty in getting what
he wanted. They came back to the Corinthian’s
Room and, with precautions against being surprised,
set to work to clear the oil-holes of the accumulated
dirt. After that, Westenhanger, with an oil-can,
liberally dosed each channel.</p>

<p>“There,” he said. “We’ll need to give the stuff
time to ooze into the bearings. Let’s go and fill in
the time with something else.”</p>

<p>They played tennis for an hour and then came
back to the Corinthian’s Room. Westenhanger had
refused to explain his purpose, and the girl was on
tenterhooks to see what he meant to do.
Westenhanger took out his paper, opened the cupboard
containing the iron chessmen, and began methodically
to set them up in the positions marked in the
Corinthian’s diagram. In a few minutes he had the
scheme completed.</p>

<p>“Now we come to the final stage,” he said. “We’ll
play over the four knight’s moves. I think that’s
the key to the thing.”</p>

<p>With considerable difficulty he shifted the white
knight from square to square.</p>

<p>“One—Two—Three. Now for it—four!”</p>

<p>The heavy iron figure dropped into its final
position—and nothing happened! Westenhanger stared
at the board in unconcealed discomfiture, and
Eileen’s face showed her disappointment.</p>

<p>“It hasn’t worked!” she exclaimed. “That’s hard
lines, Conway.”</p>

<p>“No, it hasn’t worked,” he answered, in a tone of
perplexity. “And yet I feel absolutely sure that
we’re on the right track. It all fits together too
neatly to be wrong. Those four moves ought to have
released some catch or other. I expected one of the
Chess-board squares to spring up, or something like
that. But nothing’s happened.”</p>

<p>He lifted the iron pieces one by one and restored
each to its proper place in the cupboard.</p>

<p>“There’s some step we’ve missed, evidently. I
wonder what it can be.”</p>

<p>Just as he closed the cupboard door, Cynthia
came into the room.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re here, Eileen? I’ve been hunting for
you all over the place. We want you, if Mr.
Westenhanger can spare you just now.”</p>

<p>She asked Westenhanger’s permission with a
glance; and he made a gesture of release.</p>

<p>“I’ll think over it,” he said to Eileen. “Perhaps
I may hit on something.”</p>

<p>After the two girls had left the room he stood for a
time staring at the Chess-board; but it seemed to
suggest nothing fresh to him. He returned to the
library, pulled out his copy of the Corinthian’s
document and fell to studying it once more. As he
opened out the paper, his eye was caught by the part
of the inscription which hitherto he had neglected:</p>

<blockquote class="document">

  <p>Matt. VI. 21; Luke XII. 34.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>“That’s got to come into it somehow,” he
admitted to himself. “But I can’t see the relevancy as
it stands. <i>For where the treasure lies, there will
your heart be also.</i> It sounds like the only straight
tip in the whole business—the key to the affair. But
what the devil can it mean, exactly? It’s very vague
as it stands.”</p>

<p>Feeling sure that up to that point he had been on
the right track, he went over each link in his chain
of thought; and then, in a flash, he saw what he had
previously missed.</p>

<p>“That’s it! Of course, the other text ought to
have put me on the track. He wasn’t so bemused
after all, that old bird! A deuced good mnemonic—once
one has the key. Now it all depends on one
point. I’d better leave the old man alone. He’s
getting a bit tired of questions. I’ll get hold of Eric.
He’s likely to know.”</p>

<p>Luck was in Westenhanger’s way that morning.
He discovered Eric Dangerfield sitting reading on
one of the lawns, at no great distance from the house.
His ankle was still weak and kept him tethered
within a short radius.</p>

<p>Westenhanger did not plunge immediately into the
subject which interested him, though he had little
fear of arousing any suspicion in Eric’s mind. He
was sure that at this time he had out-distanced the
Dangerfields completely, and was nearer the solution
of their family mystery than they themselves had
ever been. Luck had stood him in good stead.</p>

<p>At last he led the conversation round to the point.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve made very few changes in
Friocksheim in the last hundred years—electric light,
and so on, of course; but a lot of furniture seems
good old stuff.”</p>

<p>Eric nodded.</p>

<p>“We’re a conservative lot,” he said.</p>

<p>“That’s a good bit of tapestry in the Corinthian’s
Room. I suppose it’s hung there for long enough?”</p>

<p>“About a century and a half, I should think.
It’s taken down for cleaning, of course; but it’s
never been shifted out of the Room since it came
here. It fits the wall space exactly; and there’s no
point in hanging it in a fresh place.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got one or two pretty good pictures, too.
I like the Dutch one in your uncle’s study.”</p>

<p>“Girl trying on jewels? It’s not at all bad.”</p>

<p>“What is it? Seventeenth century? I know next
to nothing about these things.”</p>

<p>Eric professed ignorance.</p>

<p>“You’ve come to the wrong shop. I know as little
about these things as you do yourself. Try my
uncle. He’s got a turn for them; and he can tell you
the history of most of them.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger had secured the information he
needed. He changed the subject, and, very shortly
afterwards, he left Eric to his book.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said to himself, as he walked back to
the house, “is that absolutely everything linked up
at last? I can’t afford to have another fiasco through
overlooking things. Let’s see. The Latin text?
Right! Then the chess problem? Right, also.
Then the two English texts? O.K. now, I think.”
He went back to the Corinthian’s Room and stood
for a few seconds before the tapestry of Diana’s
hunting.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he concluded, “I think that’s all right also.
That’s all, isn’t it? No, it isn’t! I’d forgotten that
leather thing. The chances are it has nothing to
do with the affair; but one ought to give it a trial.”</p>

<p>He sat down and filled his pipe while he speculated.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure it isn’t a washer, though that’s
what one might have expected it to be. Now what
on earth does one use a leather disc of that size for,
unless it’s in connection with machinery. And the
old Corinthian was a bit of an inventor—more than
a dabbler in mechanics, if I’m on the right track.
And yet from the look of the thing I’m almost certain
it’s got no normal use in a machine. The twine
through it proves that almost conclusively. Hold on,
though! It might be a valve of sorts. That might
be it. But why leave a valve-piece along with the
document? That must be wrong.”</p>

<p>He thought over the matter without evolving
anything which seemed to throw light on the problem.
At last he took up a fresh line.</p>

<p>“Old Rollo suggested that it was a toy that the old
Corinthian had made for his kiddie. But then, why
leave it along with the document? That seems a
silly sort of thing to do. And from the look of the
leather, the thing had been used in some way. I
don’t know much about leather; but the way that
disc was warped. . . . It must have been wetted
and allowed to dry, or something. That would
crinkle it.”</p>

<p>Then a final flash of illumination lit up the whole
problem in his mind. He laughed partly at himself
and partly at the simplicity of the solution.</p>

<p>“Why, of course, it’s a kid’s toy. I’ve played
with the same sort of thing myself. And that’s what
he used it for. He was a bright old bird, right
enough. No wonder we got no result with the
Chess-board.”</p>

<p>He stepped into the Corinthian’s Room, drew aside
the tapestry, and examined the panelling behind it.
To the ordinary eye it showed nothing; but
Westenhanger seemed satisfied with what he saw. He let
the tapestry fall into place again.</p>

<p>“Now let’s see! Nothing doing to-day, that’s
certain. I’ll have to wait till to-morrow before I can
try it out. But I’m dead sure of it this time. It’s
no wonder the Dangerfields never got near the thing.
I’d never have been near it myself if it hadn’t been
for that talk with Eileen. Pure luck. No credit to
any of us.”</p>

<p>He turned away from the hanging and consulted
his watch.</p>

<p>“Just time, if I take the car down. The
Frogsholme cobbler first of all; and then a shop where I
can get some long needles. That fits me out. And
to-morrow I’ll give old Rollo the surprise of his life.
The bottom will be out of the Dangerfield Secret!
What a relief for the old man!”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch14">

<h2>Chapter XIV</h2>

<p>On the following afternoon, having completed all his
arrangements, Westenhanger ushered Rollo
Dangerfield and Eileen into the Corinthian’s Room.</p>

<p>“Mind if I lock the door for a short time?” he
asked, turning to his host. “I’d rather not be
interrupted by anyone in the middle of this affair.
You’ll agree with me when you’ve seen what I have
to show you.”</p>

<p>Old Rollo’s face showed more than a trace of
suspicion. Westenhanger had vouchsafed no
information about his project; and the old man evidently
felt mistrustful. However, he nodded his consent
and waited while Westenhanger turned the key in
the lock.</p>

<p>“What’s the glass of water for?” Eileen
demanded, pointing to a tumbler which Westenhanger
had in his hand.</p>

<p>“You’ll see before long,” he assured her, putting
the glass down on a table. “I think we’ll take things
one at a time.”</p>

<p>Rollo seemed to think that he had been kept in the
dark long enough.</p>

<p>“May I ask why you have brought us here?”</p>

<p>Westenhanger noticed the old man’s glance at
Eileen as he spoke, so he resolved to put matters on
a plain footing at once.</p>

<p>“Miss Cressage knows almost as much about this
matter as I do myself. Between us, we seem to
have hit upon something which you ought to know at
once. Miss Cressage, I may say, gave me the key
to the mystery. Without her help I don’t think I’d
have hit on the thing at all.”</p>

<p>At the word “mystery,” a shadow gathered on
Rollo’s face. He glanced from the engineer to
Eileen as though trying to read their thoughts.
Westenhanger hastened to reassure him.</p>

<p>“When you’ve heard the whole story, Mr.
Dangerfield, I think you’ll agree with me that Miss Cressage
has done you a very great service.”</p>

<p>The old man again scanned Westenhanger’s face
keenly, before making any reply. Evidently his
scrutiny satisfied him; for the distrust slowly faded
out of his expression and he turned to Eileen with a
faint sketch of a bow, as though making
acknowledgment and amends.</p>

<p>“I am entirely in your hands,” he said. “It’s
quite clear that you have been acting for the
best.”</p>

<p>Eileen broke in as soon as he had finished.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t take what Mr. Westenhanger says
as being strictly accurate. I really did very little
to help. In fact, I’m as much in the dark as you
are, just now, Mr. Dangerfield.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger intervened.</p>

<p>“I think it will be best to take the thing step by
step and let you see how we reached the kernel of
the affair. You’ve been doing your grandfather an
injustice, all these years, Mr. Dangerfield. He was
a better man than you gave him credit for. I’ve
seen enough to know that. And I think you’ll find
that the Corinthian’s Secret is more important than
the Dangerfield Secret.”</p>

<p>The old man winced a little at Westenhanger’s
words; but he refrained from comment.</p>

<p>“Now, to start with, would you mind letting me
have the Corinthian’s document and the leather disc
from the safe? We may as well work with the
originals, as far as possible.”</p>

<p>Rollo stepped slowly across the room, unlocked the
safe, and took out of it the two required articles
which he handed over to Westenhanger in silence.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll sit down,” said the engineer. “It’s
going to take a little while to explain the matter.”</p>

<p>He indicated three seats and brought a small table
over, so that they could all see the document which
he placed on it.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” he began, “you once told us
that your grandfather had mechanical leanings—he’d
invented some kind of geared bicycle. That
didn’t strike me at the time, particularly; but as it
came back to some purpose later on, I mention it
first. On the same evening, by pure chance, I
happened to notice these little holes at the corners of the
squares of the Chess-board on the pavement here.
These things, I mean.”</p>

<p>He rose and pointed out one or two of them.</p>

<p>“When you told us that the Talisman was safe, I
must confess I thought of a man-trap. The holes in
the pavement suggested some kind of machinery
needing lubrication; and I had some notion of a
trap-door which would open when the Talisman was
touched and so trap a thief. That was an entirely
mistaken idea, as you told us yourself. Still, at the
back of my mind I had connected these oil-holes
with the presence of some machinery or other and
with the mechanical tastes of your grandfather.”</p>

<p>The distrust had passed completely away from
Rollo’s face. He was now listening with obvious
eagerness to Westenhanger’s explanation.</p>

<p>“The next thing was, of course, your showing us
these things from the safe. They were quite
meaningless to me then.”</p>

<p>He lifted them lightly and put them back on the
table.</p>

<p>“The next bit’s hard to account for. Somehow
I got a feeling that the document was the key to
some problem or other, and I asked you to let me
copy it. It was just an impulse. I really can’t say
what I expected to do with it. It certainly wasn’t
mere vulgar curiosity to dig out the Dangerfield
Secret.”</p>

<p>Again a flicker of distrust crossed Rollo’s face.
Westenhanger saw it.</p>

<p>“You can take it from me now, Mr. Dangerfield,
that the Dangerfield Secret is of no importance
whatever from to-day onwards. Least of all to you
personally. Make your mind quite easy on that
score.”</p>

<p>Rollo nodded; but quite evidently he was not
altogether relieved from anxiety. Eileen’s face
showed that she was puzzled by Westenhanger’s
words, but she refrained from asking any question.</p>

<p>“We’ll take the document next,” Westenhanger
continued, picking it up from the table as he spoke.
“You know its contents, two texts and a
chess-position. The chess-position is a dud affair.
There’s a mate in one move staring one in the face as
soon as one looks at it. Obviously the thing isn’t
a problem, and no one would trouble to write down
an end-game so simple as this. I made nothing
of it.”</p>

<p>He looked across at the old man. Rollo’s face had
taken on its old mask of inscrutability. Quite
evidently he could not see whither all this was leading.</p>

<p>“I come now to Miss Cressage’s part in the affair,”
Westenhanger proceeded. “So far as I was
concerned there was nothing confidential in the matter.
You hadn’t pledged me to secrecy—because you had
told me nothing. Still, before speaking to Miss
Cressage about it, I asked her to promise she would
say nothing. We know that she can keep her
promises.”</p>

<p>Rollo’s glance at the girl made it quite clear that
he had full confidence in her.</p>

<p>“Between us,” Westenhanger went on, “we hit
on the key to the first text. <i>Nox nocti</i>—night unto
night. Spell the word with a K, and you get
Knight—the chess-piece.”</p>

<p>Old Dangerfield sat up sharply.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Mr. Westenhanger, two generations
of us have puzzled over that scrawl, and not
one of us saw it. I congratulate you on
your acuteness, both of you. That was very clever
indeed.”</p>

<p>“Just a chance,” Westenhanger had to admit.
“It’s a thing one could only hit upon in the course
of talk, and even then it would be only by accident.”</p>

<p>Rollo’s indifference had slipped from him
completely.</p>

<p>“And next?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll set up the position on the big
Chess-board before we go any further,”
Westenhanger suggested. “I have a reason for that, as
you’ll see.”</p>

<p>He went to the case holding the chessmen and set
up the pieces one by one on the pavement squares.
Then he returned to his seat and took up the
document again.</p>

<p>“You see two white knights? Knight unto
knight sheweth knowledge. That means, as I read
it, that one knight can do something which the
other knight can’t do. Very little examination
shows what that thing is—it’s an unaided mate in
four moves. Thus.”</p>

<p>He moved the one white knight successively from
square to square until it reached the mating position
on Queen’s Seventh. Eileen watched eagerly,
expecting that this time something would happen, but
she could detect nothing whatever. Westenhanger
had noticed her attitude. He looked across the table
at her with a smile.</p>

<p>“That’s what you saw me do yesterday. Now I’ll
tell you what I was looking for.”</p>

<p>He turned to Rollo.</p>

<p>“You know that each of these pieces has a long
spike on its base which slides into the holes in the
Chess-board? On the surface it looks as if that had
been designed merely to keep the pieces from being
knocked over by anyone who has to walk among
them in order to shift them from square to square.
But I had at the back of my mind the idea of the
old Corinthian as a man with a mechanical turn,
and I put that idea alongside the notion of the spikes
and the sequence of four fixed moves by the white
knight. And so I reached the idea of . . .”</p>

<p>He looked interrogatively at his hearers, but
neither of them had caught his meaning.</p>

<p>“Of a combination lock!” he concluded, after a
pause. “Your grandfather was more of a mechanic
than you gave him credit for. As I understand the
machine—of course, this is only guess-work—under
each hole in the four squares of the knight’s moves
there lies the end of a lever. When you drop the
knight into its place on the square, the spike
depresses the lever. The whole secret of the thing is
that the four levers must be depressed in that
particular sequence. That guards against the lock
being sprung in the course of normal play. The
chances against that combination are considerable;
and I expect some of the other pieces also depress
lock-levers, so that it’s almost impossible that the
thing should be unlocked by a chance game. In
fact, the whole affair is simply a clumsy forerunner
of the ordinary dial lock on good safes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it hasn’t opened!” commented Eileen.</p>

<p>“It <em>has</em> unlocked something, though,”
Westenhanger retorted. “That was what puzzled me
yesterday when apparently nothing happened after I’d
played the moves. But the Corinthian was taking
no chances. The Chess-board is the lock, but the
thing it secures is somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“That sounds nonsense to me,” Eileen said,
decidedly.</p>

<p>Westenhanger smiled with a touch of friendly
maliciousness.</p>

<p>“We’ve still two things which we haven’t used.
This is where I went wrong yesterday, Eileen,” he
interjected. “There’s another text, and there’s
the leather disc. Take the text first of all. <i>Where
your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</i>
Remember the pun in the first case? There’s another
one here. I didn’t spot it for a while.”</p>

<p>He challenged Eileen’s ingenuity with a look across
the table and left her to puzzle the thing out for
herself.</p>

<p>“Not see it? I’ll give you a clue. ‘As pants the
hart for cooling streams . . .’ ”</p>

<p>He caught her eye and his glance led her gaze
round the room till it came to the tapestry of Diana’s
hunting.</p>

<p>“Oh, now I see!” she cried. “You mean there’s
something hidden behind that stag—the hart—in
the arras!”</p>

<p>Westenhanger assented with a nod.</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield had maintained his serenity up
to this point; but evidently he now felt the strain.</p>

<p>“Mr. Westenhanger,” he said. “You’re not
leading me on to a disappointment? I’ve guessed at
something behind all this. Please do not keep me in
suspense.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger felt ashamed of the comedy he was
playing. He had not thought of how it must appear
to the man most concerned. At once, in response
to old Rollo’s rather pathetic query, he dropped
the pretence that the issue was still unknown.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, Mr. Dangerfield. In trying to
make it interesting I’m afraid I forgot that you
might be anxious about the end of the business—afraid
it was all going to peter out in an empty
treasury. I’ve only been making believe that I’m
working this out step by step as we go along. Of
course I’ve done it all once before and found the
real thing I was looking for.”</p>

<p>Old Rollo’s old-fashioned courtesy returned to
him.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to have interrupted you,” he
said. “Please go on with your story. I am quite
ready to wait for the end when it comes.”</p>

<p>He settled himself in his chair, evidently
restraining all signs of impatience. Westenhanger
continued.</p>

<p>“You’ll have no cause to regret our intrusion into
your affairs, Mr. Dangerfield. I can promise you
that. I’ll go on. With this needle I can prick
through the arras and fix the exact position of the
hiding-place behind the cloth. You see the stag’s
very small; anywhere near the centre of the body
will do. I put the needle clean through and leave
it sticking in the panel behind, to mark the place.”</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word, then he lifted
the tapestry and disclosed the panelled surface.</p>

<p>“Nothing visible in the way of a handle, you see?”
he pointed out. “The panelling’s quite smooth.”</p>

<p>He dropped the tapestry into place again and came
back to the table.</p>

<p>“Now this leather disc,” he picked it up as he
spoke. “You suggested to us that it might be a
child’s toy. That was what eventually put me on
the track. It <em>is</em> a child’s toy. I’ve played with
one like it when I was a child myself, though I
haven’t seen one for years now. Possibly the
modern child doesn’t use things of that sort. But in my
young days they used to call them ‘suckers.’
Here’s one in its normal state.”</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a disc of leather with a
loop of twine attached, exactly like the Corinthian
relic, except that Westenhanger’s leather was soft
and moist.</p>

<p>“I’ll show you how it works.”</p>

<p>He dipped it for a moment into the glass of water,
then placed it flat on the table with the twine loop
on the upper side.</p>

<p>“Now I squeeze it into contact with the table, so
as to exclude all air between it and the wooden
surface. The water acts as a seal. That’s right.
Now I pull vertically upwards on the twine. You
see the centre of the disc is pulled up by the twine.
That makes a vacuum between the leather and the
table; and the pressure of the atmosphere pins the
‘sucker’ to the wood. The harder you pull, the
faster it sticks. It’s exactly the way a limpet sticks
to a rock; and you know how tight that clings.
With a thing of this size, I could lift an ordinary
paving stone out of its bed. We used to pull up
quite big stones with them when I was a kiddie.”</p>

<p>By levering the ‘sucker’ adroitly he loosened
it from the table, just as a limpet is slid off its bed
by a side-thrust.</p>

<p>“I think the rest’s obvious. The Corinthian
wanted some means of pulling out that particular
panel without leaving any mark or attaching a
handle. He used this sucker for the purpose. I’ll
show you.”</p>

<p>He went over to the arras, lifted it, and attached
his leather disc at the point where the needle had
been. A slow, steady pull on the twine completed
the work, and a large piece of the panel came
forward, evidently the end of a drawer fitting back
into the wall of the room.</p>

<p>“Your grandfather’s safe deposit!” said
Westenhanger.</p>

<p>As Rollo came forward, the engineer dipped his
hand into the drawer.</p>

<p>“Some loose things on top. Will you take them,
please? Let’s see. A diamond pendant. . . . A
jewelled collar, isn’t it . . . ? And this. . . . Here’s
something else. . . . There are one or two more, I
think, further back in the drawer.”</p>

<p>He stretched his arm into the cavity, felt about for
a few moments, then grasped something. His voice
changed as he turned round with it in his hand.</p>

<p>“The <em>real</em> Talisman, Mr. Dangerfield!”</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>Chapter XV</h2>

<p>Eileen Cressage watched the old man eagerly
stretch out his hand and take the armlet from
Westenhanger’s fingers.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Conway?” she exclaimed.
“The <em>real</em> Talisman? Why, you saw the real
Talisman put into that safe over yonder not three days
ago by Mr. Dangerfield himself. How do you come
to have it here?”</p>

<p>For once, Rollo Dangerfield was so moved as to
forget his courtesy.</p>

<p>“Is it the real thing?” he asked Westenhanger,
with anxiety obvious in his tone.</p>

<p>The engineer reassured him.</p>

<p>“I don’t profess to be an expert; but I can tell
the difference between paste and the genuine article.
These diamonds are the real thing.”</p>

<p>Rollo carried the armlet across to the window and
examined it minutely. Eileen followed him, still
mystified by the turn of events, though the
explanation was beginning to shape itself in her mind.</p>

<p>“The end of the Dangerfield Secret, isn’t it?”
asked Westenhanger, joining them. “I was pretty
sure of my ground when I told you that the Secret
had ceased to be of any importance now.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield’s lapse into unintentional
brusqueness had been only a momentary one, under
the stress of strong emotion. Already he had
recovered his balance.</p>

<p>“You can perhaps understand something of what
this means to me, Mr. Westenhanger, even if you
don’t guess the whole story. It’s sometimes difficult
to find words for what one has to say. I wish to
thank you—and you also, Miss Cressage—for this.
You can have no idea of the load which you have
taken off my shoulders. You have cleared away the
shams, and I can look people in the face again,
unashamed. It’s useless to put these things into
words. I can’t do it as I would like to do. But at
least I can tell you, Miss Cressage, something of
the Dangerfield story which will give you an idea of
what this has meant to us.”</p>

<p>He made a gesture inviting them to sit down again.
Eileen seated herself, but Westenhanger paused for
a moment.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better shut this thing up before
we go any further.”</p>

<p>He indicated the still open drawer in the panelling.</p>

<p>“Just wait a moment until I empty it completely.”</p>

<p>He put his hand into the recess and withdrew
several other pieces of jewellery which he added to
the shining heap on the table. Then he closed the
drawer, dropped the arras, and came back to the
Chess-board.</p>

<p>“You remember you told us that after the
Corinthian’s death they found the pieces on this board in
the position shown on the document? It’s pretty
obvious what was in his mind. He knew that he
might be killed in a few minutes. Probably he
mistrusted his servants and was afraid to leave family
jewellery at their mercy. So he opened the secret
recess, tumbled the jewels into it—the Talisman was
in it already—and then he closed his combination
lock . . . thus.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger walked on to the Chessboard and
lifted the white knight from Queen’s Seventh.</p>

<p>“One reverses the four moves, so, bringing the
knight back to its starting-point on the knight’s
square.”</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word, carrying out the
four operations in the reverse order.</p>

<p>“Now the drawer is locked,” he explained.
“That’s what the Corinthian did, just before he
went out to his duel. And that’s why they found
the Chess-board in this state. Probably he hadn’t
time enough to put the pieces away in the cupboard,
so he left them standing as they were. They gave
nothing away.”</p>

<p>He picked up the document, the wrinkled leather
disc, and his own “sucker”; and handed them across
the table.</p>

<p>“That finishes our part, Mr. Dangerfield. Now,
perhaps, you’ll tell us what you wish us to hear.”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield’s face had regained its
accustomed serenity. The tinge of suspicion had
vanished completely and was replaced by a trustful
expression, as he looked at his two guests. He turned
first to Eileen.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you have been kept waiting for an
answer to your question, Miss Cressage. It was
my fault. You will forgive an old man’s impatience
when I tell you that you and Mr. Westenhanger
have cleared up something which has hung over
fifty years of my life. And there are other reasons,
too, as you will hear.”</p>

<p>Eileen had no need to say anything. Her face
told Rollo that she had not been offended.</p>

<p>“You startled me not long ago, Mr.
Westenhanger,” their host went on, “by asking me if the
Dangerfield Secret was not just three generations
old. If that was a mere guess it was a very good
one. Actually, what has been called the
Dangerfield Secret originated in my father’s day; and since
it has been passed on to Eric it has lasted through
three generations. And now it passes away, thanks
to you young people.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment before speaking
again.</p>

<p>“You must bear in mind that some of this is
conjecture, and that I am trying to fit it together so
as to take in the facts which have come to light this
afternoon. Before I came into this room I had not
the key to the problem; and I have hardly had time
to fit the new links into the chain neatly. But it
seems evident to me that even in my grandfather’s
day, there was a Talisman and a replica; and that
the replica was kept under the tinted bell to conceal
the fact that the stones were false. From your
inferences, Mr. Westenhanger, it seems clear that he
devised this particular hiding-place for the real
Talisman.</p>

<p>“Now take the state of affairs on the morning of
my grandfather’s death. He knew the risk he ran—his
opponent was a noted duellist; and he had no one
at hand whom he could trust. Probably, as you
suggested, he collected the more valuable family
jewels and placed them with the real Talisman for
safety’s sake. We did him an injustice when we
assumed that he had already sold them to pay his
gambling debts.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to speculate on his mental condition
at that moment. Quite probably, after a night’s
carousing he was not clear-headed. He jotted
down the memory-help he used himself as a clue to
the hiding place, and very probably he failed to
realise that it was no real help to anyone but himself.
Then he went out—and that was the end.”</p>

<p>With quite unconscious dramatic effect the old
man paused in his narrative and sat for some
instants in silence. When he spoke again it was in a
lighter tone.</p>

<p>“And now I come to a fresh character. I never
knew him, but I have been trying to reconstruct
him in my mind from many things which were told
to me about him. He was the solicitor for the
Dangerfield estate at the time my Corinthian
grandfather died.</p>

<p>“Imagine his position, Miss Cressage. He takes
over the administration of the estate—you remember
that my father was a mere child then—and he finds
it terribly encumbered with the debts which had
accumulated in my grandfather’s day, a load of
liabilities which even a generation failed to clear away.
Credit was essential if the ship was to be kept afloat
at all. And the biggest asset of the estate was the
Dangerfield Talisman. So long as that remained,
no one could suppose that things were seriously
involved, and with care, he could just pilot us through.
Without that palladium, the creditors would have
come down at once and the game would have been up.
Friocksheim would have come to the hammer.
Everything would have gone down in the crash.
And in the midst of all his anxiety he learned that
the Talisman was a sham of gilded lead and spurious
stones!”</p>

<p>Rollo broke off his narrative, leaving time for them
to appreciate the position.</p>

<p>“I have seen the document in his own
handwriting,” he continued, “which gives an account of
the affair. He had taken the Talisman from under
the bell and asked a jeweller what it would cost to
make a replica. He thought the thing should be put
in safety; and it seems that he, too, had hit on the
idea of substituting a counterfeit for the real thing,
the notion of a stalking-horse which I explained to
you once before, Mr. Westenhanger. And you can
guess his consternation when he learned from the
jeweller that the thing was worth no more than a few
pounds. The whole mainstay of his scheme for
keeping the Dangerfield credit secure, now turned out
to be worthless. There was no other easily-vended
article—all the valuable jewellery had vanished,
sold to pay the Corinthian’s debts, as we have
wrongly believed until to-day.</p>

<p>“He had to come to a decision. Rightly or
wrongly, he chose his course. He started the
Dangerfield Secret as we have known it. He quieted
any suspicions of the jeweller by ordering ‘a second
replica.’ And he embarked on a career of
concealment. It was safe enough. The Corinthian had
had the armlet valued out of curiosity. Everyone
knew it was worth £50,000. No one had any
reason to suppose that it had gone astray. And with
that sham asset behind him to strengthen confidence,
he pulled the estate out of its immediate difficulties.
I have no right to criticise him. He worked
according to his lights, with the sole purpose of handing
over Friocksheim to my father when he came of
age.”</p>

<p>It was plain enough from the old man’s tone that
he himself might have chosen the same course had
the alternatives been offered.</p>

<p>“We have paid dearly enough for his decision,”
Rollo went on. “He involved us all in his
machinations, even those of us who were born long after he
died. When my father came of age, the old solicitor
laid the whole case before him. The estate was still
in a shaky state, and an involuntary liquidation
would have left us insolvent. More, in a forced sale
we could not have hoped to pay our creditors in full.
We’d have been defaulters and real losses would have
been incurred by innocent people. On the other
side, by keeping up the estate’s credit, we gained
time enough to pay in full, eventually—to be honest,
in fact—provided that the Talisman deception could
be kept in being. It was merely a choice, you see,
between two forms of dishonesty; but the one
alternative would hurt other people, whilst the second
course laid a burden on ourselves alone. My father
chose the second path. I cannot say that in his
position, I would have done otherwise myself.”</p>

<p>His face took on a bitter cast.</p>

<p>“That was the beginning of the Dangerfield
Secret—the trickery of the spurious Talisman. Can
you wonder that I described it to you, once, as a
memorial of lying and deceit? How do you suppose
I felt, being driven to lie to my own guests in my
own house every time I was asked to show it to
anyone? The famous Dangerfield Talisman!”</p>

<p>He moved in his chair, almost as though he wished
to free himself from some physical contamination.</p>

<p>“And all the time, we were in the toils which that
old man had wrapped around us a century ago.
How could we shake free from that web of
deception? We still need the asset—at least we needed
it yesterday. And to let the thing leak out would
be to put a black mark on my father’s name. You
know what people would say about the part we
have played. There was no getting clear. We had
to go on as we had begun.”</p>

<p>He glanced at his two guests as though he feared
that he had wearied them by a long story; but
their expressions encouraged him to continue to the
end.</p>

<p>“People often wonder why we do not insure a
thing of such immense value. How could we insure
it? It would need to be valued—and the game
would be up! So we have been forced into that
second series of deceptions—the return of the
Talisman after it has been stolen. We have to keep a
series of replicas; and put out a fresh one every time
there is a theft. We have to play that silly game
of pretending we believe in an old legend—another
lie—because we dare not call in the police if the
thing vanishes, and because we dare not admit that
we have lost it.”</p>

<p>Rollo’s voice became gloomier still.</p>

<p>“And in front of us, always, there was the risk of
an inevitable exposure. We had to avoid the
Government valuers in the matter of Death Duties. We
could do that only by transferring the Talisman from
hand to hand. My father made it over to me when
I was twenty-one; I gave it to Eric when he came
of age. It has never been subject to Death Duties
yet. But there is always the chance of accident.
If Eric died before me the whole thing would have
been exposed when they came to value his estate.
That possible Nemesis has been imminent for the
holders of the Talisman.”</p>

<p>He seemed to brood for a time on his retrospect.
When he spoke again, both his voice and manner had
altered. It was as if at last he had emerged from
the shadows.</p>

<p>“And now, after a century of deceit, we’ve come
out into the light again, thanks to you both! And
to think that the Talisman was here all the time,
within the walls of Friocksheim. Of course we had
puzzled over the Corinthian’s cypher; but we’d never
taken it seriously, because we believed all along
that he had sold the armlet and the jewellery. It
never occurred to any of us that the thing was within
our grasp, under our very roof. Even his own man
of affairs believed that, and it never crossed our
minds that anything else could have happened.”</p>

<p>“I think it was very natural,” said Eileen.</p>

<p>Westenhanger made no comment. He had been
touched, like the girl, by the story of the Dangerfield
Secret as it was now revealed. By his candid
narrative old Rollo had enlisted their sympathy without
having directly besought it from them; and they
could understand the feelings which his position had
stirred in him through fifty long years.</p>

<p>“No wonder he often looked as if he’d grown
sick of life,” was the younger man’s unspoken
comment.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all right now, isn’t it?” he said aloud.
“The Talisman’s come back for the last time.”</p>

<p>Eileen broke in, before the old man could reply.</p>

<p>“You’ve no idea how glad I am that we are able
to help, Mr. Dangerfield. Less than a week ago, I
felt that Friocksheim was a place I’d never want to
visit again; it had such miserable associations in my
mind, in more ways than one. But now, somehow,
it’s all different. We can all be happy here; there’s
nothing hanging over any of us any more. You
understand, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Rollo Dangerfield looked at her with something
like affection showing in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Who could understand better than I do? It’s
like waking out of a nightmare to find the sun shining
in through the window. And we owe our
awakening to you and Mr. Westenhanger. You don’t
imagine I under-rate that, surely? I dare say you
think you understand what this means for me;
perhaps you have some faint conception. But unless
you had actually gone through it yourselves you
couldn’t come near the real thing. It’s lasted fifty
years, and that’s only a few years less than your
two lives put together. And now—daylight! I
shall be glad to have a year or two of decent life
at the end of it all.”</p>

<p>Westenhanger saw something in the old man’s
eyes which made him interpose with a fresh
subject.</p>

<p>“And what about the Talisman now, Mr.
Dangerfield? Will you use the Corinthian’s safe deposit
still? It’s lain there safely enough all these years.
That’s why I locked the door—so that no one should
blunder in and notice the hiding-place when it was
open. I thought you might want it again.”</p>

<p>“The Talisman?” repeated Rollo. “Do you know,
I could almost find it in my heart to sell the
Talisman—give Wraxall his desire, after all. If I had a
decent excuse for doing it, I think I would. I’ve
hated it for years. But I suppose we must keep it,
now that it’s come into our hands again. I want no
more possible regrets, and one might regret having
let it go, after these centuries. We don’t need to
sell it; there are other things to sell.”</p>

<p>He bent over the table and examined the jewellery
which had come from the Corinthian’s hiding-place.
After a careful scrutiny he picked up the diamond
pendant and turned to Eileen.</p>

<p>“You talked about your memories of Friocksheim,
Miss Cressage, and, believe me, I was touched by
what you said. Now I should like you to have
something which will always remind you of the old place
in that aspect.”</p>

<p>He offered her the glittering gems, and, when she
made a gesture of refusal, he continued as though
he had not noticed it.</p>

<p>“I know you don’t wear jewellery, so in its present
form it would hardly serve. But this central stone
would set well in a ring. Get it taken out; and do
as you please with the rest—sell them, if you choose.
There’s no sentiment in the matter; for I intend to
sell the rest of the things here and use the money to
clear our feet at last. So you are free to follow
that good example if you please.”</p>

<p>He saw her expression and tried a different
argument.</p>

<p>“If you refuse, I shall feel that you think I have
been trying to pay you for your help—and that you
flung the payment back. Nobody could find a real
payment for what you and Mr. Westenhanger have
done. This isn’t payment, Miss Cressage. It’s a
thank-offering, if you care to put it in that way. I
still hope you won’t refuse.”</p>

<p>Eileen saw the pain in the old man’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I ought to refuse,” she said, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Then, after another look at Rollo’s face, she
added:</p>

<p>“But I can understand how you feel. I’ll take
your gift, though it’s far too valuable. And I’ll do
with it just as you wish. We needn’t pretend to
misunderstand each other, need we? I’ll sell some
of the stones and clear my own feet, just as you’re
going to clear yours. And I’ll wear the ring to
remind me of Friocksheim, though I won’t need it for
that.”</p>

<p>She took the pendant and examined it,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely thing . . . I feel rather tongue-tied,
Mr. Dangerfield,” she confessed with a smile.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that,” he smiled in response.
“You’ll understand better now, how I felt myself
not many minutes ago.”</p>

<p>And with that he brushed her thanks aside.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing you can do, Miss Cressage.
Come back often to Friocksheim. I shall look
forward to your coming. You’re one of us, now, and
not merely a visitor; for you know more about our
affairs than some of our family ever knew. You,
too, Westenhanger. We’re going to need young
people about the place, since we shall be losing
Helga. . . .”</p>

<p>Suddenly his face changed. A smile came over
it, the first really care-free smile that had crossed it
in fifty years. The touch of wistfulness had
vanished—it was the natural Rollo coming out at last
after the long suppression.</p>

<p>“Helga’s birthday falls next week. She will be
twenty-five—the age when our girls are told the
Dangerfield Secret. What a disappointment for her
when she learns that now there is no Secret at all!”</p>
